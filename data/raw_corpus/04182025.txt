Challenge Takes
Over Campus

CADE RUTKOSKE

Years later, the Ice Bucket
Challenge is back. Over the course
of the past week, the University
of South Carolina’s (USC) Active
Minds Ice Bucket Challenge has
taken Andover’s campus by storm.

Active Minds is a non-profit
organization dedicated to promot-
ing mental health. The challenge
originated from USC’s Active
Minds club and requires partici-
pants to dump a bucket of ice wa-
ter on their heads in order to raise
awareness about mental health.
Participants also share the video
on social media and “nominate”
others to the challenge.

Brinley Davis ’27 was one
student who participated in the
challenge. She explained how
the challenge has quickly spread
awareness for mental health
across Andover while connecting
students.

“Tt was very fun and I learned
about it two weeks ago from my
friends at home. It’s a good way to
spread awareness, [and] on cam-
pus, it’s definitely raised mental
health awareness on its own. It’s
also increased community bond-
ing and happiness,” said Davis.

As a Co-Head for Andover’s
Active Minds Club, Drew Wasy-
lyshyn ’26 has been involved with
the national organization since
before the trend began. He hoped
that the rapid expansion of aware-
ness would encourage schools
across the nation to start their
own chapters.

“A lot more people know about
Active Minds and their mission
now. I was looking at the USC
chapter’s Instagram page over
the last couple of days, and their
followers went from 30,000 to
270,000. This initiative has been
spreading across the nation like
wildfire. It warms my heart. It’s
just a simple act that raises aware-
ness,” said Wasylyshyn.

Second Head of School Day This
Year Grants Four-Day Weekend

STAFF REPORT

Head of School Raynard
Kington announced that the
second Head of School Day
(HOSD) this year would take
place on April 22. Standing
on the steps in Pan Athletic
Center (Pan), Kington raised
his signature dark blue hat to
the cheers and screams of stu-
dents who had gathered for a
Head of School munch. Typi-
cally just an annual event, this
second HOSD marks a depar-
ture from tradition since one
has already occurred this Win-
ter Term.

All classes, sports, and oth-
er commitments will be can-
celled on April 22, extending
the Easter long weekend to a
four-day weekend. Kington
shared what he hopes students
will take away from the extra
day off.
“Vll_ be working all day
Tuesday, I assure you. But that
suits the day off. It’s just sup-
posed to be about students.
I hope that students will do
whatever they feel helps them
stay balanced, invigorated and
healthy,” said Kington.

Bruce Ru ’27 described his
excitement at Kington’s an-
nouncement. Although Ru ini-
tially felt confused, he called
on other students to spend
this HOSD responsibly by us-
ing the additional time to take
care of themselves.

“[It’s] not only a time to
just celebrate that we have an
extra day off but also [a time]
to look inwards and to talk to
the people [around you], check
in with everybody, including
yourself, and think about how
we can be using the time to
make your life and other peo-
ple’s lives better,” said Ru.

Last year, HOSD was post-
poned to the Spring Term due
to an unexpected outbreak of
sickness during the Winter
Term that resulted in two days
of cancelled classes. Angie

Lucia ’25 commented on how
having a HOSD in the spring
allowed students to enjoy the
weather.

“Ym very excited. It was
very unexpected and very
cool that he did one for the
Spring Term. Last year, hav-
ing it during the spring was so
fun because [there] was good
weather. We could lawn. The
time was really well spent, so
it was a really good idea to do
one in the spring,” said Lucia.

Jonathan Oh ’27 expressed
how the announcement caught
him completely by surprise.
Walking back from Falls Mu-
sic Center with the Goose &
Moose band after rehearsal
to his dorm, Oh recalled his
amazement upon hearing that
classes were cancelled next
Tuesday.

“People [were] going back
to their dorms, and we were
on our way to Pan. They were
saying [that] we have Head of
School Day on Tuesday, and I
[thought], ‘No way. I thought
it was only last year where it
was in the Spring Term. It’s
awesome. It’s a_ three-day
weekend turned into a four-
day weekend. I’m hoping the
weather is good on Monday
and Tuesday. I’m very grateful
to Dr. Kington for doing this,
especially when a lot of people
are getting sick. It’s great tim-
ing,” said Oh.

With Spring Term being
relatively short, Oh empha-
sized how HOSD could be use-
ful to recover physically and
academically.

“T have the flu right now,
so I’m just planning to get
extra sleep and then get back
on track with my health and
my coursework. Spring Term
is really fast and short [this
year], so having this extra day
to ground myself is really real-
ly nice,” said Oh.

EBI Program Cancelled for
Juniors and Lowers to

Focus on Community
and Individual Wellbeing

PRISHA SHIVANI &
JEANNE KOSCIUS-
KO-MORIZET

An email to Juniors and Low-
ers on April 11 informed Under-
classmen that Equity, Balance,
and Inclusion (EBI) classes are
cancelled for Spring Term. The
email relayed hope to instead see
students at campus events meant
to foster community and individ-
ual wellbeing. This cancellation
came one week after the loss of a
student by suicide.

Brigette Leschhorn, Transi-
tional Director of the EBI Pro-

ii

gram, spoke on the main reason

for the cancellation. She, among
others, felt that the priorities of
the EBI curriculum did not match
up with what the student body
needs right now.

“Usually the priority of EBI is
developing social emotional skills
and community building skills.
Now the priority has to be how
do we care for ourselves and each
other. You cannot learn things if so
many folks around you are in dis-
tress. It makes more sense to shift

“Voice of the Consumer”:
Paresky Commons Updates

Menu with Feedback Survey

FELIX BRET
& SOPHIA TOLOKH

To solicit student feed-
back on menu options, Pare-
sky Commons (Commons)
launched a new survey plat-
form called the Voice of the
Consumer (VOC) on January
30. Displayed daily through-
out Commons, the survey
asked community members
to rate items they liked and
disliked using a five-star rat-
ing system. Over 80 people re-
plied within 48 hours.

Since the platform’s
launch, Commons has main-
tained a rating of 4.04 out of
five stars overall, according
to Karen VanAvery, General
Manager of Paresky Dining
and Campus Catering. VanAv-
ery explained how Commons
responded to survey feedback
when updating their menu
this term.

“Changes implemented
this semester include: Grilled
chicken added to the salad
bar three days a week, the in-
troduction of additional hot
vegetarian options, additional
vegan items, including des-
serts, expanded Halal options
and the return of Tomato
Bisque (an extremely popular
request!),” wrote VanAvery in
an email to The Phillipian.

Van Avery continued “At
Paresky, menu and program
changes are made thought-
fully — based on nutritional
needs, variety, data analysis,
seasonality, guest feedback,
and ingredient availability.
Students can request specific
menu items directly through
the survey, and if a suggestion
becomes popular, we’ll do our
best to add it to our offerings.

Some additional reforms
implemented in Commons
over the past couple of months
include adding corn tortillas,
and placing jerk seasoning
and malt vinegar at seasoning
stations. Some of the largest
changes, however, is the insti-
tution of Waffle Wednesday

ing to Danielle Han ’28.

“The grilled chicken at the

salad bar is a game-changer.
It’s really good on salads and

n November 5, 2024,

Donald Trump was re-

elected President of the
United States of America. In
retrospect, this result has come
to be seen as an inevitability, ob-
scuring that millions of Ameri-
cans had expected an entirely
different outcome until the end
— myself very much included. I
know I’m also not alone in con-
fusion and disappointment at
the lackluster response of Sena-
tor Chuck Schumer and other
Democratic Party leadership to
the new lows of this Trump Ad-
ministration’s disregard (and, in
some cases, apparent contempt)
for American values, interests,
and institutions. But to find
its optimal bearing from here,
the Democratic Party must de-
velop a solid sense of where it
went wrong — and I can’t help
but feel the currently dominant
too-moderate and too-“woke”
explanations fall short of cap-
turing the true reasons for the
party’s defeat last November
— to help the party determine
where it goes from here.

Firstly, I think it’s important
to consider the factual results
of the November elections and
question some of our conclu-
sions from them. For instance,
it has practically become con-
sensus to describe Trump’s
performance as a “landslide,”
but this deeply misrepresents
the scale of his victory. Trump’s
victory in the national popu-
lar vote — despite feeling like

Editorial

Thank You for Nominating Me...

“...for the @uscmind challenge.”

In the past week, our socia’
have been flooded by videos of shivering peers
laughing as ice-cold water cascades over their
heads. Since the University of South Carolina’s
Speak Your Mind Ice Bucket challenge went
viral, people all over the world have taken up
this challenge and nominated their friends in
a campaign to spread awareness about mental
health. This trend echoes a prior one, when the
internet was also filled with people dumping ice
water over their heads for the 2014 Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Ice Bucket challenge. Yet
the modern version of this classic challenge has
become slightly different.
While the #SpeakYourMIND challenge is
intended to bring awareness to mental health,
this challenge has become more of a trend and
social outlet instead. Despite the challenge
diverging from its intention, we must ask
ourselves whether or not this is actually a
fully negative thing. In the first two weeks,
the #SpeakYourMIND challenge has garnered
over 33,000 dollars in donations. Although this
number may seem significant, when compared to
the ALS Ice Bucket challenge that raised around
115 million dollars, it seems less effective. For
these reasons, this challenge may draw criticism
as another shallow internet trend that overlooks
the deeply meaningful cause of mental health
advocacy. These concerns are valid but unfair.
Rather than view this cynically and dismiss
this trend as the triumph of shallow, short-form
media over serious subjects such as mental
health, or another instance of mass performative
activism, let us reflect on the way that this trend
has positively impacted communities.

Remembering how the ALS challenge
created intergenerational connections between

media feeds

celebrities, public figures, adults, and kids,
perhaps the #SpeakYourMIND challenge can do
the same. Behind every upturned water bucket
and round of nomination is a deeper desire: to
recapture the essence of a tight-knit community.
Whether we see a student walking in soaking wet
clothes on the paths, a suspiciously large puddle
and wet footprints on the pavement, or people
running around with recycling bins full of water,
there’s no judgment, only knowing looks and
exchanged smiles. It’s fun, nostalgic, and a little
silly; after all, how can we feign being calm, cool,
and collected when bucketfuls of cold water are
gushing over our heads? When the water hits,
we can’t help but scream — it’s an absolutely
authentic reaction that is a welcome break from
the artificial, glossy lives often advertised on
social media.

Regardless of whether the USCMind challenge
ends up raising as much money as the 2014
Ice Bucket challenge, it still succeeded in two
important respects: raising awareness for mental
health and fostering connection, which is at the
heart of fighting mental health struggles in the
first place. This challenge unites all by virtue of
our collective engagement. #SpeakYourMIND
has crossed generations, travelling from coast to
coast and transcending national boundaries, so
why not join in? When your name is the next one
to be nominated for the challenge, grab a bucket,
find a friend, press record, and say, “Thank you
for nominating me...”

This Editorial represents the opinions of The
Phillipian, vol. CXLVIL.

a shock to many — was the
weakest since 2000, a year
when the candidate who won
the popular vote didn’t even
win the election. The idea that
certain states or demograph-
ics have experienced a unique
swing towards Republicans is
similarly misleading; Latino
voters, for example, did swing
towards Republicans relative
to 2020, but voted for George
Bush 20 years ago in greater
numbers than for Trump this
year. These mentalities — re-
inforced by mainstream media
— that inflate the Republican
Party’s victories have subdued
many previously outspoken
Democrats, leaving the party’s
mindset weaker than it needs
to be. Further, when searching
for a reason behind their slip-
page among previously reliable
voter groups, Democrats should
look no further than this exact
sort of monolithic analysis. This
reductive thinking isn’t just
wrong; it’s limiting Democrats’
optimism and thus their ability
to strategize effectively for fu-
ture elections.

Next, Democrats should
take a look at where their re-
cent victories have come from
— because they have seen con-
siderable success over the last

year. Democrats won major
statewide races in five of the
six swing states where they
were held alongside the presi-
dential election, and generally
improved their performance
among high-propensity, more
affluent, predominantly white
communities. In 2023, Demo-
cratic Governor Andy Beshear
of Kentucky won re-election
over a Trump-endorsed Re-
publican opponent — and he
did it without deviating to the
left or right relative to standard
Democratic stances. Governor
Beshear was re-elected by one
of the reddest states in the na-
tion, and he did it while pro-
tecting transgender kids and
also without declaring himself
a socialist. Instead, Beshear’s
personal popularity — paired
with the success of his govern-
ment in resolving substantive
issues like responding to flood-
ing in 2022 — carried him to
victory in a state where Repub-
licans hold all other statewide
offices. Democratic-aligned
state supreme court candidates
continue to triumph in swing-
state races, while reproductive
rights and minimum wage pop-
ular vote initiatives have won
in states as red as Missouri and
Kansas. The Democratic Party’s

brand might be damaged, but it
is running on winning issues.

Democrats should turn to
the examples of Dan Osborn in
Nebraska and Evan McMullin
in Utah — independent candi-
dates, supported by Democrats,
who came impressively close
to winning Senate elections in
generally Republican elector-
ates. Examining Democrats’
successes reveals that posi-
tioning themselves as outsid-
ers to the political status quo
(which has historically thrust
Democrats like Barack Obama
as well as Republicans like
Donald Trump into office) can
help bridge the gap between the
Democratic Party’s low approv-
al ratings and the clear popular-
ity of their policies more than
shifting course on those issues
ever could. To divorce their
optics from the perception of
their politics as ineffectual and
corrupt, perhaps it’s time for
Democrats in competitive races
to abandon lip service to the na-
tional party.

For the first time in 20 years,
the Democratic Party must
grapple with being the less
popular of the two in presi-
dential politics. But between
the election’s actual results,

Democrats’ recent successes,

and examples of more success-
ful optics for the party, there is
no reason for Democrats to give
up hope. Democrats don’t need
to moderate like the unsuccess-
ful recent example of California
Governor Gavin Newsom, nor
should they abandon their cur-
rent positions for a more radi-
cal approach. Democrats can
and must invest in the optics
of popularity and play to their
strengths on the issues, but we
must first resolve the party’s
confused sense of direction.
We must accept the political
appeal of the outsider image
without forsaking consistency
in our policymaking, unlike
Republicans’ capitulation to
Trump on isolationist foreign
and economic policy. Where we
go from here isn’t so different
from where we are now. Once
we realize that, stay the course
on most policy issues, and im-
prove their image in other ways,
Democrats will get our chance
to lead once again.

Why Your Screen Time Is Lying to You

very Sunday morning,
millions of phones de-
liver an anxiety-inducing
message: “Your weekly screen
time average was...” Guilt hits
us, and once again, we begin to
operate under the assumption
that reducing one’s screen time
is a one-way ticket to better
health, happiness, and produc-
tivity. However, this weekly re-
port, although accurate in terms
of minutes, is misleading in
its interpretation. Screen time
shouldn’t be judged by duration

TikTok follows. Then Twitter.
As the apps disappear from the
screen, headlines flash through
your mind like digital ghosts:
Social media is rewiring your
brain; scrolling leads to lower at-
tention spans; too much screen
time is linked to depression in
teenagers. You aren’t just delet-
ing apps, you’re attempting to
cleanse a kind of digi-
tal shame. But

within
hours — or
days, the apps
are re-download-
ed. Because the real
problem — the under-
lying reason behind the
usage — was never truly ad-
dressed.

Let us compare two people
who spend an average of four
hours on their phones. One
spends those four hours doom-
scrolling on Instagram’s high-
ight reels or running an infi-
nite loop of TikToks. The other
spends those same four hours
catching up with loved ones on
FaceTime, learning content on
YouTube, and reading informa-
tive articles. Despite the dif-
ferences in the quality of their
digital lives — and how it affects
them — they see the same de-
contextualized number on Sun-
day morning.

This oversimplification
leads us to pursue superficial

solutions without considering
the underlying problem. It re-
duces a complex, varied digi-
tal life into a binary judgment:
more time equals bad, and less
time equals good. Viewing the
number displayed as the sole
determiner of digital well-be-
ing wholly undermines all the
good that can be accomplished
through our electronics and
causes unnecessary guilt. Con-

sequently, we
tem-

porarily delete social media
apps, vowing never to use them
again, only to find ourselves
back online within a week. The
cycle makes us feel worse and
unimproved because we have
not addressed the actual prob-
lem.

Skeptics may point out that
higher screen time has been
linked to cognitive drawbacks,
such as diminished atten-
tion spans and mental fatigue.

However, research from the
American Psychological Asso-
ciation shows that only passive
scrolling results in increased
anxiety, loneliness, and unhap-
iness. Active, engaged screen
time — such as connecting with
oved ones, learning content, or
ursuing creative endeavors —
has been found to actually im-
rove affective states, cognitive
growth, and relational attach-
ment. It’s not just about how
much time we spend online, but
how we spend it.
Furthermore, a
emphasis on decreasing screen
time ironically creates digital
anxiety, which may provoke
even more compulsive
scrolling behaviors.

avoid. The weekly notifications,
intended to promote digital
well-being, are actually a source
of digital anxiety, doing little to
deter people from unhealthy
phone usage. To break this cycle,
digital wellness should not be
viewed as a matter of avoiding
screens altogether, but rather as
intentional usage. The tension
between wanting to disconnect

measures to aid student life
with varying efficacies — for
organizational purposes, we
will categorize such into three
categories: systemic academic
inflexibility, the lack of mes-
saging, and schedules that
force students to move on too
fast.

The first category is the
inflexibility in the academic
policies for the past few weeks,
namely, the 50 percent work-
load policy for the first week
and the staggering of major as-
sessments by department. Al-
though the policies may have
worked well for some students,
others felt a loss of agency over
our own journey with grief.
Simultaneously, it expected us
to advocate for ourselves for
academic or mental health
support. An email from Dr.
Raynard Kington sent on April
3 read “If you are struggling to
reset academically please reach
out to... the Dean of Studies Of-
fice. You will not be penalized
for seeking help.” The people
who need help the most, who
likely feel desolate and unmo-
tivated, are required to speak
to a faculty member they may
have never met in their lives
about the deeply personal
journey of grief. In these ab-
normal times, the academic
and mental health support
that the Academy has provided
should have been mandated for
everyone. Students should be
able to opt into assignments,
tests, and opt out of class if ac-
companied by an adult without
question. The strategy to cope
with productivity should be
reserved for those who truly
prefer this method, but this is
not how we cope. The expecta-
tion on the students to find the
courage for self-advocacy in
some of the darkest times they
have undergone in their lives is
contradictory to the academy’s
statement.

The second category is how
the inflexibility of student
schedules unfortunately ren-
ders mental health support
resources inaccessible. Staffed

with Riverside experts on trau-
ma, Sykes Wellness Center pro-
vided a comforting presence
on campus for struggling stu-
dents. However, mental health
support was provided often
during the school day and oc-
casionally extended to after
school hours — it required us
to either skip lunch or class. In
our case, even the after-school
hours conflict with our sports
or music block, where there
is little flexibility in that too.
Many of us who needed that
help chose to bear it through to
not fall behind. Current avail-
able mental health resources
do not consider actual student
life, and the expectation to re-
turn to coursework without
universally accessible mental
health resources implicitly in-
validates student struggles and
complaints as ingratitude.

The third category relates
to the Academy’s lack of trans-
parency and explanation of
its measures. One example is
how we hosted revisit days one
week after Lucas Lee’s death.
The revisit day scheduled the
same Friday as the week of
Lucas’ death was canceled,
but another took place the fol-
lowing week. We understand
that revisit is an integral part
of the admissions process at
Andover, however, we are just
kids. We simply cannot recover
from a friend’s death so quick-
ly to serve the school’s cause
and give new students the au-
thentic Andover experience.
We acknowledge the need to
meet the deadline for boarding
school commitment, but these
extraneous circumstances that
affected the present student
body should have overridden
the custom of revisit day, an
event meant to benefit the in-
coming student body. We un-
derstand that the administra-
tion has their own reasons for
enacting specific actions, how-
ever, largely leaving the reason-
ing and intent in the dark from
the student body has caused us
more harm than necessary. For
instance, let us broaden this

ing screen time and craving
the connection we get through
our phones fuels a loop of com-
pulsive behavior. We fear what
we’re missing, feel ashamed of
what we’re doing, and yet, do
it anyway. By turning wellness
into a competition against a
number, we ignore the root of
the issue: a lack of mindful tech
use. So instead of accepting our
screentime at face value, what’s
needed is a practice of careful
reflection: Did my screen time
today make me feel connected,
creative, or informed? Am I ac-
tively consuming or shaping my
digital experience?

Digital wellness should
not be viewed as a
matter of avoiding

screens altogether, but

rather as intentional
usage.

Next Sunday, when your
phone lights up with that famil-
iar notification, don’t accept it
at face value. Don’t let a single
metric tell you how to feel about
your day or your habits. Instead,
take control of your digital nar-
rative. Recognize that mindful
digital living is measured not
by the seconds spent staring at
your screen, but by what you do
and how genuinely fulfilled you

feel.

that we do not misinterpret the

Hyperempathy: Drenched in Others’ Emotions

yper-drenched
sponges that are not
squeezed out prop-

erly rot and fall apart; so do
hyper-drenched humans. At-
tempting to absorb (often
without success) all the woes,
angers, and glees of the world,
then sitting there without
sucking the emotions out,
we end up forgetting what it
means to be a dry, squeaky-
clean sponge. As such, hy-
perempathy occurs when one
overly cares about others’
emotions and ends up mir-
roring them. The emotional
fatality of hyperempathy lies
in the misconception that em-
pathetic people are always ca-
pable of self-care as well. Tak-
ing care of our own emotions
before empathizing others al-
lows us to make the most out
of empathy.

Since childhood, I had
been considered very emo-
tional; poignant movie scenes
brought me to tears and a
sharp immature comment
from a friend would bother
me for several weeks. I took
each and every interaction se-
riously, guessing the implied
meanings behind each word
and adjusting my actions ac-
cordingly. As I matured and
learned that many, if not most,
daily interactions do not car-
ry much emotional weight, I

Mere py?

n Ancient Greece, reading
[« coveted as a crucial skill

at the height of canonical
knowledge. Nowadays, reading
is much less appreciated; an in-
convenient practice that expends
too much mental energy for full
engagement. By contrast, the an-
cient philosophers embraced the
lack of simplicity attributed to
reading. They promoted its cre-
ative interpretations, urging the
reader to consider each literary
text from philosophical, spiri-
tual, scientific and political av-
enues. By contrast, the modern
world lacks such emphasis on
the written word and often for-
gets the importance of reading
within education and the work-
force. Currently, only a small mi-
nority of the population reads,
partly due to the attention and
patience required to grasp the
meaning of a literary text fully.
Arguably, the declining frequen-
cy of readers worldwide can ex-
acerbate numerous issues within
education systems, beginning
with the heightened loss of in-
tellect, speech articulation, and
accurate interpretations of piv-
otal concepts. Most often, these
studied concepts originate from
classical prose and thus cannot
be logically understood and ap-
plied to the real world without
intentional and valid reading
skills. As we move forward in a
world that prioritizes instant

thought I had graduated from
the stage of being an emo-
tional child. Yet, it took me
a lot of tears, anger, and bro-
ken relationships to realize
that the child who sobbed
when Mufasa from the “Lion
King” died was hiding inside
me all along, begging me to
let herself shine once again.
Throughout my early teenage
years, in exchange for learn-
ing to overcome criticisms,
I began absorbing people’s
emotions and the following
burdens instead. Talking to a
sobbing friend who had just
lost a pet or comforting my
brother who had gotten a low
grade on an exam subdued
my mood for the entire day,
if not the whole week. The
hyperempathy extended be-
yond sorrow. In one instance
when a beloved faculty mem-
ber from my old school was on
the brink of getting fired, my
broken self attempted to bat-
tle against the school admin-
istration and parents by peti-
tioning the employment office
(quite hastily and without
sufficient research). Likewise,
hyperempathy influenced me
beyond emotions; it led me to
make hasty decisions.

My teachers, friends, and
even I assumed that these
events were the result of kind-
ness — a desire to take care of
and benefit others. Perhaps
kindness did partially con-
tribute to the abrupt mood
changes and unprepared yet
good-willed actions but, look-
ing back, the cause of all these
rash actions and emotions
was empathy. Likewise, it can
be challenging to differenti-
ate between acting based on
our own feelings and those of
others — both causes are of-
ten expressed through helpful
actions and covered beneath
the blanket of empathy. Upon
closer examination, the dis-
tinction grows clearer. People

gratification, we lose the value
of reading, causing the deterio-
ration of our education’s quality
and discourse with one another.

Predominantly, the impacts
of declined reading in education
unfold from the overall reduc-
tion in national reading rates.
According to a survey released
by the National Endowment
for the Arts, the proportion of
American adults reading litera-
ture dropped to less than half be-
tween 1992 and 2002. Further-
more, in 2022, the rate dropped
to 37.2 percent, representing
a loss of over 20 million adult
American readers. This wide-
spread reduction of engagement
with literature across the coun-
try is correlated with increased
accessibility of passive methods
of information recall, including
television, radio and most sig-
nificantly, artificial intelligence
modules. Such technological ad-
vancements tend to hinder the
necessity of reading, reducing
the time needed to understand
complex ideas. They therefore
provide more efficient and time-
effective engagement for the
user. Though the enhanced ef-
ficiency of such outlets may be
attractive, passive forms of tech-
nology impose great detriment
on information systems with
their foundations in reading
classical texts and studies, with
education at the forefront of the
affected systems. Consider, what
would happen to an educational
institution if its students were
representative of the statistics
above? Would a student feel as
secure in their collective aca-
demic discussion if each inter-
locutor’s source of information
originated elsewhere than tra-
ditional reading methods? The
simple answer is no, the student
should not feel secure. Primar-
ily, it is irrational to artificially
engage in a topic that attracts
its roots from the written word.

mation from a search engine

one may feel fulfilled pro-

friend as that act of kindness

those who act out of empa-
thy, or hyperempathy, spend
a significant amount of time
considering the emotions of
those who need help, and pre-
vent themselves from feeling
satisfied until the struggling
people feel better. Such con-
siderate behavior may seem
positive at a surface level, yet

Hyperempathy silences
our inner voices. When lis-
tening to others’ concerns
and dedicating our emotions

to their stories, we wear
their vision and think from
their viewpoints. Wearing

sidering our own thoughts,

younger self, all I could care
about was the well-being of

that poses as an insufficient al-
ternative. To extend, the search
engines in question are based
on algorithmic iterations of in-
formation, rather than cohesive
logic and thinking. As such traits
are considered pivotal for the
consolidation of knowledge, re-
liance on these methods would
inevitably reduce intellect by
diminishing the integrity of the
student’s understanding and en-
gagement with material.

gression of this argument, many

of the current youth will re-
spond, yes, they would still feel

how they were feeling at the
moment. I defined my own
circumstances as being insig-
nificant compared to others in
need. A few instances of such
dedication may be beneficial,
yet repeated instances of pri-
oritizing others’ emotions
over ours eventually drain
many of us, both physically
and emotionally. There comes
a point when you cannot fo-
cus on daily tasks or manage
your feelings because you be-
gin overthinking the implied
emotions behind each dia-
logue and action. For instance,
if someone says “I had a rough
day,” a hyperempathetic per-
son may be imagining several
scenarios of why that per-
son is struggling and con-
stantly and excessively check
on them throughout the day
while neglecting their own
duties and needs. Likewise,
hyperempathy slowly eats up
one’s emotional bowl until
one gets confused whether
their emotions originate from
themselves or others.

Don’t get me wrong — em-
pathy is a crucial asset for
humans and is currently lack-
ing in many facets of society.
Hyperempathy, on the other
hand, can negatively affect
not merely ourselves but also
those whom we are trying to
support. Sometimes, people
need space to consider their
emotions and circumstances
before reaching out to other
people to do the job for them.
A way to deliver empathy in
the most effective manner is
recalling the perhaps cliched
yet still meaningful saying:
your bowl must be full before
you can fill others’. Though
the saying may sound simple,
asking a hyperempathetic
person to immediately ap-
ply this lesson can be diffi-
cult for them. For those who

secure. To preserve the integrity
of education, they should not.
Indisputably, Artificial Intelli-
gence (AI) is the strongest cul-
prit for reduced engagement and
understanding of reading, par-
ticularly among young individu-
als in higher education. In 2024,
a global survey from the Digital
Education Council reiterated the
overwhelming surge of AI, as 86
percent of all students reported
the self-inclusion of AI in their
daily academic work and assign-
ments. As the non-disclosure
agreement survey evaluates the
overall numbers of declined
readers in the national popula-
tion, it calls into question the
root causes and consequences
on individual comprehension
and writing caliber instigated
by the reading decline. Tangen-
tially, in a 2023 study from Duke
University, students’ compre-
hension of texts with additional
assistance from AI encountered
a 12 percent decrease in accu-
racy. This proves calamitous for
the quality of intellect on uni-
versity campuses,  transition-
ing into weak representations

but as an instinctive response,
it is surely difficult to start
taking care of our emotions
firsthand. An easier habit to
implement would be speaking
from our experiences and our
needs when speaking empa-
thetically, such as introducing
similar struggles we have had
or emotional hills we had to
hike over. This slight change
in communication can enable
us to ponder our own emo-
tions before connecting them
to others’ struggles.

In a boarding school like
Phillips Academy,
tions journey akin to diseas-
es. Close proximity causes
“catching” others emotions to
occur ona daily basis. As a de-
fense mechanism, many stu-
dents might find themselves
in the rabbit hole of hyperem-
pathy, attempting to mingle
with the community by step-
ping into the shoes of every-
one else. As students spend
four years with similar people
in this school, it is important
to distinguish our individual
emotional boundaries to that
of others. Wear your own
shoes before you help others
try out theirs.

abide by. Theorize the impacts
when combining the decreased
accuracy of comprehension with
the multitude of students relying
on AI. Naturally, the majority of
academic material would lose its
prior quality and become tainted
by the auto-generated inter-
pretations of AI. If AI replaces
the human perspective, the text
interpreted becomes victim to
objective interpretation, disre-
specting both our brain capac-
ity and the value of the text. In
tandem, the overall educational
experience loses its integrity by
replacing books with objective
interpretations of intellectual
topics. It is strictly impossible
to benefit from the intellect pro-
duced by Al’s algorithmic re-
sponses, which are verily devoid
of the central educational prin-
ciples of creativity, subjectivity
and free thinking.

Thus, if the frequency of read-
ing continues to decline among
adults and students, there will
undoubtedly be grave threats to
future educational discourse and
instruction. As AI becomes more
accessible, students are more
prone to avoid the additional ef-
fort required from reading, thus
losing the ability to attain raw
intellect based on their indepen-
dent thoughts and perceptions.
If our educational habits transi-
tion to become concentrated on
passive information recall, we
disrespect the origins of aca-
demic inquiry and instill great
instability within classrooms.
As we consider the role of books
compared to AI, we must not
forget their potency and instead
maintain the value of their varie-
gated messages that contribute
to our potential for authentic
and undisturbed intellect.

Hailey Piasecki ’27 shared
that an important improve-
ment to Commons would be
tracking how much of a spe-
cific food people consume.
In particular, she pointed to
Salisbury steak as an unpopu-
lar item.

“I feel like [Commons]
could figure this out really
easily based on [how] every
time they have poke bowls, ev-
eryone comes and is rushing
the line, [but with] Salisbury
steak, it’s like a ghost town...
They should just have some
record of how much people
actually eat of [each food]. Be-
cause it’s just going to [cause]
so much food waste. They’ve
had Salisbury steak since my
dad was here and he remem-
bers hating it. It’s been 40
years too long, people. Let’s
take that off the menu,” said
Piasecki.

Owen Huang ’27 saw Com-
mons as an important space

for community gathering. He
noted how the option of or-
dering takeout could deter
students from dining there.
“[Commons] is a good spot
where people can get togeth-
er and have lunch and eat the
same food, it’s a good place
for building community. To
encourage people to eat at
Commons, [we could] crack
down on ordering DoorDash
in the middle of the day when
Commons is open... That
could cause food waste,” said
Huang.
Changes in Common’s
menu also aims to expand op-
tions for those with dietary
restrictions, including the in-
troduction of allergen-friend-
ly apple crisp. Kaya Mangani
27. expressed appreciation
for how Commons accommo-
dates individual preferences.
“I know [that some stu-
dents] often complain that
Commons has no food, but
they actually do a really good
job. They cater to a lot of dif-
ferent dietary restrictions. It’s
really great how they have
something for everyone, even
if it is just [at] the salad bar, at
least you have something that
you can eat,” said Mangani.

Extra Time in Place of EBI

to caring for the community rath-
er than developing skills. That is
our priority now,” said Leschhorn.

Leschhorn had invited the
EBI Uppers to an optional lunch
to talk about the next steps of the
EBI program this spring. During
the conversation, student leaders
reflected on their experiences in
the program. Frank Hu’26, an EBL
Upper who participated in the
conversation, explained the diffi-
culty of EBI to meet the students’
and faculty’s needs.

“The takeaway before
[Leschhorn] made the decision
was that it’s very difficult for EBI
to meet everyone’s needs. Some
lowerclassmen weren't affected at
all, and some were deeply affect-
ed. Same with teachers — some
were very affected, some not at
all. Her rationale was that EBI
doesn’t have the resources to give
a tailored experience to people
at different points in the grieving
process so she decided to cancel
it,” said Hu.

Hu further explained the dif
ficulty of returning to normal
programming and shared appre-
ciation for Leschhorn’s decision,
as it eased the workload of many
students and gave them time to
connect with friends and reflect
on what happened.

“For EBI 9 in Spring, it would
cover things like life skills and
time management. Important top-
ics, but it feels strange to teach that
right now. If we were going to talk
about mental health, I wouldn’t
even know how to approach it.
It was the right decision. Every-
one’s in different places. One thing
we talked about was how the 50
percent reduced workload gave
us time to reflect. [Leschhorn]
really considered that and want-
ed to give us back those extra 40
to 50 minutes per week, so EBI
wouldn’t be an extra burden,” said
Hu.

For some students, the deci-
sion to cancel EBI this term felt
like a thoughtful response to the
varying ways people were griev-
ing. Ryan Baek ’28 noted that the
unstructured time gave students
space to process individually.

“The cancellation allowed ev-
eryone to process the situation

in their own way. I think grief is
personal, and having less struc-
tured time gave people space to
cope however they needed to.
Plus, based on last year’s [State of
the Academy,] where I think only
about 15 percent of students found
EBI to be effective, it makes sense
that the school chose not to con-
tinue it this term,” said Baek.

Leschhorn elaborated on the
campus events she is hoping to
organize for the Juniors, Lowers,
and Seniors, as Upper Carnival
is already set in place for Uppers.
She stated her main goals for these
upcoming events

“[For] the events that I’m try-
ing to put together, the planning
is happening this week and next
week. Hopefully I can announce
them soon... I have to make sure
that it’s something that will be
appealing to students and will be
helpful. The goal behind them
is to make the campus feel more
enjoyable and fun and so our cam-
pus can come together and bond
over these events. We should
come together as a community
and find joy in each other’s com-
pany in really difficult times,” said
Leschhorn.

PASC Launches Food Waste Challenge to Start Earth Month

The Phillips Academy Sustain-
ability Coalition (PASC) kicked off
Earth Month with the Inter-ESA
Food Waste Challenge, an ini-
tiative aimed to limit food waste
during lunch over three Thurs-
days, including April 10, 17, and 24.

Each day, volunteers stationed
before the busing conveyor col-
lected and weighed uneaten food,
disposable food service items, and

inedible food waste. Andover is
competing against other New En-
gland schools, among them Phil-
lips Exeter Academy and Hotch-
kiss, to generate the least amount
of post-consumer waste. The
school that tallies in the lowest av-
erage between all three days will
be deemed the winner.

The Inter-European Space
Agency Food Waste Challenge
acts as an Extension of the work
the PASC has done in the past
years, including the Green Cup
Challenge where dormitories
compete against each other to be

energy efficient. Allison Guerette,
Campus Sustainability Coordi-
nator, detailed the purpose of the
Food Waste Challenge and the
larger Andover Climate Action
Plan.

“The Food Waste Challenge
raises awareness about the envi-
ronmental, social, and econom-
ic impacts of food waste, and it
moves us closer to our Climate
Action Plan goal of becoming a
Zero Waste campus by 2030. Zero
Waste means increasing diversion
of waste from landfills and incin-
erators and reducing total overall
waste,” wrote Guerette in an email
to The Phillipian.

Guerette continued, “The goal
of the food waste challenge is to
raise awareness about food waste
in general and offer small strat-
egies in the dining hall setting,
such as starting with a portion you
think you will eat, with the under-
standing you can return for more
or another menu item. We want
students trying new foods and get-
ting the nourishment they need.”

Moreover, according to a 2018
Food Waste Challenge video, An-
dover produces approximately
730 pounds of food waste every
day. Jessica Zhao ’27 expressed
that the presence of monitors in-
centivized her to reflect on the

items she chooses to dispose of.

“I would say that the challenge
has reduced my waste because
when you see the people at the
station standing there, it really
makes you think and reconsider
the items on your plate. It makes
you think about whether or not
you should be wasting certain
items, or if you're actually able to
finish the food on your plate. As
students at Andover, we do waste
agreat deal of food because of how
widely accessible it is. It’s really
not beneficial for the environment
at all,” said Zhao.

The student volunteers are
Ecoleaders: representatives that
educate their respective dormi-
tories about sustainable choices
and initiatives. Bruce Ru ’28, an
Ecoleader from Rockwell House,
voiced excitement regarding his
involvement with the program.

“(The challenge] represents a
major advance in the work we’re
doing because Ecoleaders actual-
ly think about the world. If we’re
not doing any tangible work, if
we're just talking to the commu-
nity, while that’s obviously a very
important part of the, process-I
believe it was very important to
actually do some of the ground
work and show people that there
are decisions you can make that

don’t necessarily have to decrease
your quality of life. Being envi-
ronmentally conscious is about
making tangible choices, and I’m
very proud to be supporting them.
Having an event like this really
puts the problem in people’s faces,
and I think that is very essential,”
said Ru.

Amy Oku ’25, Co-Head of Eco-
Action, explained how the chal-
lenge was started to have students
be more aware of their food waste
and motivate them to take smaller
servings.

“Even though [Paresky] Com-
mons feels like it has endless food,
people should be more aware of
how much they take. Some take
a lot because they don’t want to
wait in line again, but that leads
to waste. I know friends who do
that and still leave food on their
plates. I hope they learn from it,”
said Oku.

Oku added that while uneat-
en food is composted, if the food
is uneaten, Commons donates to
food banks.

“Any untouched food at Com-
mons goes to food banks, but
post-consumer food waste ends
up in compost. It’s never eaten
and wastes energy. I don’t think
people realize that when they
throw away food,” said Oku.

Sam Clare ’25  present-
ed their Community and
Multicultural Development
(CaMD) Scholarship Presen-
tation titled “From Playing
Indian to Virtue Signaling:
American Summer Camps’
Reckoning With Racism” last
Friday in Kemper Auditori-
um. Through connecting with
parents and camp organizers,
Clare examined how anti-In-
digenous racism is embedded
in camp traditions and urged
audience members to take ac-
tion.

Drawing from personal
experiences, Clare began an
introspective journey exam-
ining their own time at sum-
mer camps. Clare’s personal
history as a camp participant
proved useful during the re-
search process, as it estab-
lished a foundation of shared
experience that fostered trust

Challenging Camp Culture: Sam Clare ’25
Pushes Back On Anti-Indigenous Narratives

and authenticity in their in-
terviews with the various in-
dividuals involved in these
camps.

“In 2020, I started learn-
ing a lot more about systemic
racism in the U.S., and I re-
considered my own past and
wanted to learn more about
it... Especially as kids, you get
thrown into these camps, and
you don’t know what you’re
doing. Oftentimes, parents
don’t even know what they’re
signing their kids up for ei-
ther. When I was talking to
people over the summer and
interviewing them, I came
with my own perspective of
being someone who went to
camp, too. It definitely made
the camps a lot less defen-
sive because they knew that I
was part of this as well,” said
Clare.

Clare pointed out that sum-
mer camps are often accept-
ed without question because
they feel like a natural part of
growing up. They encourage
people to dig deeper when a
situation feels off and not to

shy away from uncomfortable
truths about the history of
summer camps.

“Camps are something that
people don’t really question
because it just seems like such
an integral part of people’s
summers. My family didn’t re-
ally question it before, so just
like I’d say that if something
seems awry or if something
seems not quite right, look
into it. Don’t be afraid of his-
tory and making people un-
comfortable,” said Clare.

Zadie Robinson ’26 ex-
plained that cultural ap-
propriation in camps is fre-
quently overlooked due to its
normalization within these
environments. She empha-
sized that presentations like
Clare’s serve a crucial role in
raising awareness and cata-
lyzing change, even when be-
ginning on a small scale.

“Sam said they tried to
implement a change into the
curriculum, and only one per-
son spread awareness about
the fact that it was Indigenous
People’s Day. I feel like cultur-

al appropriation in camps is
something that happens a lot,
but people almost bat an eye
at it, and normalize it. It’s just
good that people like Sam are
spreading awareness of things
like this. I truly think just
spreading awareness, even in
small groups, is a good start,”
said Robinson.

Robinson further empha-
sized that some students com-
plete their entire Andover
education without any mean-
ingful exposure to Indige-
nous perspectives or critical
examination of anti-Indig-
enous camp practices. This
educational gap, she noted,
perpetuates ignorance around
cultural appropriation issues
and prevents many students
from recognizing problem-
atic traditions they may have
experienced in summer camp
environments.

“This topic isn’t something
Andover has really shared
about. Like Sam said, they’ve
never been assigned a book
written by an Indigenous per-
son except by the one elective

they were in. Sam said they
tried to implement a change
into the curriculum and only
one person spread awareness
about the fact that it was In-
digenous People’s Day,” said
Robinson.

Connor Scheidt ’25 reflect-
ed on his experience with
camps and emphasized the
importance of recognizing
when they are disrespectful
or offensive.

“In the Midwest, where I’m
from, these summer camps are
a big part of middle school and
high school culture during the
summer months. I haven’t re-
ally thought about these kinds
of summer camps for a while
since I haven’t gone to a sum-
mer camp for the better part
of a decade. Just bringing it
up and recognizing that these
camps are distinctly disre-
spectful and offensive is the
right thing to do next,” said
Scheidt.

What introduced you to
The Phillipian?

l initially joined The
Phillipian on a whim.
A Freshman girl in my
dorm, Mary Lord [24],
was on the Eighth Page,
and she [told me], ‘you
should join, it’s so much
fun, you’ll be great at it’
I was not funny at all, but
I thought it was going
to be easy going and so
I joined. I was honestly
looking for something
fun to do. When I came
to Andover, a lot of things
I did at home, at middle
school, that brought me
joy didn’t translate into
my life at Andover in the
same ways. I just joined
it as something I thought
would be really fun and
make me happy. I never
necessarily had goals of
doing any serious journal-
ism, I didn’t even under-
stand how The Phillipian
worked.

How was the adjustment
from your role in the
Eighth Page to being the
EIC?

It’s funny because a lot of
people assume that The
Eighth Page to the [Edi-
tor in Chief] route was a
huge jump. In some ways

it was, but also on the
Eighth Page, you [have
to] think about if a joke
is okay to publish, who it
will be impacting, [and]
who we are represent-
ing. Also there have been
articles at the Eighth Page
that have been far more
critical of people and
things at Andover than
even other Commentary
articles. It’s something
you’re very cognizant of,
just the politics of the pa-
per, which is a big part of
being Editor-in-Chief. In

a lot of ways just looking

at how we are represent-
ing the students, what
changes are the students
looking for, [and] student
relationships with the
administration.

If you could have dinner
with a famous person,
dead or alive, what
would it be?

I’ve had [Amanda]
Foushee, [instructor of
English] as my English
teacher for five terms
at Andover and she has

fundamentally really
changed the way I under-
stand English and been
one of the best teachers
I’ve ever had. The first
term of this year was
based on Virginia Woolf,
and my class had such
interesting conversations
about it, about her nov-
els, and especially Mrs.
Dallaway. That was one of
my favorite [books], and
so I would actually like to
have a conversation with
her. But actually I want
her to be in my classroom.
I wouldn’t just want it to
be one-on-one, I would
want her to be in my
classroom.

What particularly in-
terested you about Ms.
Foushee’s Women Liter-
ature class?

In our current political
climate, there’s just a

10 Questions with
Louisa Carter

REPORTING BY KRISSY ZHU & ANDY GAO

Louisa Carter was the former Editor in Chief (EIC) of The Phillipian Vol. CXLVILI. Prior to
her role as EIC, Carter wrote for The Eighth Page which she joined in her Freshman Year. The
Phillipian was Carter’s first experience with journalism; she is also passionate about ceramics

and used to row for Andover’s Crew team.

heightened sense, es-
pecially amongst girls,
of what it means to bea
woman right now [and]
being taken seriously.
That’s something that I
know I feel, and I know
a lot of my friends feel.
How can you be tak-
en seriously right now
when the current ad-
ministration does not
respect women? Being
in this class, we talked a
lot about what it means
to have autonomy as a
woman, what it means to
choose the life that you
want, and not necessarily
have external forces dic-
tate what you are capable
of and what’s possible.
That was what was so
great about being in
that class. It felt like my
opinions and my beliefs
were taken so seriously by
my classmates in a time
where that is rare.

Reflecting on your time
as Editor in Chief, how
was your experience?

I have said this to so many
people, it was the best
thing that could’ve hap-
pened to me at Andover
and I’m so lucky to have
had the experience. Being
involved on the paper on
any level really gives you
this level of awareness
and interest in the great-
er Andover community
[and] an understanding of
what’s going on and see-

ing beyond the immediate
scope of your life here. It
was a really great experi-
ence for me too to under-
stand the impact of local
journalism. The impact
it has on the community
and the voice it gives to
students, and when you
want to enact change,
the change that has been
made on campus, a lot of
times The Phillipian has
a big role in that. Being a
part of something bigger
than me in that sense is
just something I will al-
ways really appreciate.

What other commit-
ments or hobbies do you
have outside The Phil-
lipian?

Something that I’ve
actually done forever is
work at a ceramics studio
in the summer. I’ve done
this since I was 14, and I
just work full time in the
summers. I teach camps,
I teach adults, and I also
run all the kilns and stuff.
It’s something I’ve always
been into doing and ’m
actually lucky enough
right now to be in [Sam-
uel] Zaeder’s last term of
ceramics since he’s re-
tiring. That’s something
that I do, and being part
of that community, is also
what drove me to The
Phillipian. The ceramics
studio is very eclectic, it
has a lot of people who
just retired and are bored,
or parents who are having

E. LIU/THE PHILLIPIAN,

a break from their kids
or college kids who are
looking for extra money
so they sell their stuff.
It is such an interesting
community, [and] that’s
partially what drew me to
other places on campus
like The Phillipian.

Do you feel like there’s
parallels between trying
to manage a group of
kids during summer and
The Phillipian?

No one in The Phillipian
is like those 12 year old
boys who are springing
water at me and throwing
clay, but I would say a lot
of those kids you get on
those camps are really
different. You’re going
to get kids that are super
quiet and kids who are re-
ally quirky people. What
it taught me is being able
to make those relation-
ships and get along with
people who are really dif-
ferent from you. They are
a lot younger than me so
it’s super different from
The Phillipian, but I didn’t
know a lot of people when
I came into The Phillipian
and now so many people
who were in the news-
room [are] people who
I’m really close friends
with, so that’s part of
what it taught me.

Did you experience any
personal growth while

April 18, 2025

in The Phillipian?

At Andover, there aren’t
a lot of student-driven
spaces where understand-
ing the world, politics
and also what’s going on
within the Andover com-
munity is really valued
and [you’re] able to have
discussions about that.
When I joined the Eighth
Page, I was in the news-
room more, and I was
meeting new people, not
just people on the Eighth
Page. It really struck me
as this is the space where
that kind of dialogue and
disagreement is really
encouraged and valued
and your ability to par-
ticipate in that is really
recognized. That’s what
made me really continue
doing The Phillipian be-
cause that was something
I never necessarily had
thought to be required of
me and asked of me, and
that was a very rewarding
experience.

Were there any specific
moments that you re-
member where you felt
accomplished?

There were a bunch
of articles that we had
throughout the year, es-
pecially in the Fall, where
we tried to do a lot more
hard news articles. We
did an anti-racism task
force follow-up, [and] a
lot of reporting on the
school’s role in educating
students on the conflict in
Israel and Palestine. We
also did some editorials
that were pretty forceful
and gave voice to some of
the students’ opinions and
hopes for the administra-
tion. I’m proud of those
because something that
nobody tells you [when]
you take on a leadershi
role in something like The
Phillipian, [is that] it’s
really scary. It feels like
there are so many people
who are always going to
disagree with you and
you’re never going to be
making everyone happy,
and that’s a really hard
thing to deal with. We
worked so hard on those
articles and really made
sure that they were fool-
proof and factual. That
was just such a great feel-
ing because I knew they
were done well. Inevita-
bly, some of them enacted
change in a way that I was
really proud of.

Are there things that
you feel like you didn’t
finish, or are hoping
that the next board con-
tinues in the future?

A lot of the work at The
Phillipian that Upper
Management does is very
much behind the scenes.
A lot of it is policy work.
For example, a lot of arti-
cles in The Phillipian were
published online during
a time where the inter-
net wasn’t what it is now,
and everything wasn’t as
successful as it is now. So
really rethinking how we
ethically handle this and
making sure that people
don’t write an article
when they’re 15-16 and
then facing repercussions
for it now that they have a
professional job.

Phreedom of Speech

After the Friday debate, the Andover Equivalent of the Dem
primaries, the real debate only just began. OWHL scholars stayed
up till exactly 9:30 tallying up the votes. Ultimately the decision
of our “democratic” election was up to the trustees.

For years the outdated electoral college has worked to polarize
our country. Thirsty for change, Co-President candidates David
and Piper decided to take matters into their own hands. The pair
are champions of the Hey developed Libertarian party —a
party that caters to what the people want (and need) by being
fiscally liberal and socially republican. Truly the best of both
worlds. Instead of five dollar ian ey stimulus checks, Diper
promised job opportunities for students to work at the Den and
at Commons, creating a far stronger source of income. Diper also
pledged to the student body to recruit the best and brightest of
Andovers Robotics, Rocket, and Math club to form an Innovation

dorms were not proposed in the election, leading WQS to
descend into an anarchist regime, as day students took over

Commons for a good ten minutes, before realizing the food sucks.

WON - Swing state in the wrong direction. The cluster, usually
pitted against WQS in a North vs South Korea type duel (WQN
is north, everyone wants to get away from Rockwell), joined

in celebration when they had another student rise to power.
With how many school resources are required to manage these
devious dorms, rumor has it that this cluster would have been
sent to Siberia (Russia, which is slightly better than the JV
football field) if they did not get a erection into office to
start paying off debt.

The Masters Tournament is Decadent and Depraved

As I stepped off Pappa’s PJ and felt the balmy Georgia air, I felt like
the narrator in “Heart of Darkness.” Thankfully, lam a straight white
male, so this did not bother me at all. I was at the Masters because

I have a long history with golf (see straight white male). Ever since
my Scottish ancestors stepped off the Mayflower and founded the
Plymouth Rock Country Club on Native American territory, we've
been dodging bunkers and land acknowledgements. Plus, like most
pro golfers, my favorite thing to do is cheat on my girlfriend. On
paper, my handicap is +3, meaning I have to give my friends three
“strokes” whenever we play. Others suggest that, in reality, my hand-
icap is debilitating alcoholism and “ADHD.” That's why I've come to
be known as the John Daly of Andover (and the John Daly of Casino
Night. Also the John Daly of the Sanctuary policy). Due to my WASP
heritage, it was tough seeing an Irishman win the Masters, but a car
bomb did explode his golf cart during the playoff on 18. Thankfully,
no one was injured in the blast (14 caddies were killed). I did relate

to Bryson Dechambeau, because when Rory Mcllroy ignored him, I
remembered the hundreds of women who ignore me at Andover. If
things keep up like this I might have to switch to LIV Golf. While the
LIV tour doesn't offer history, prestige, class, or top-tier golf, at least
the money is good!

Boys Lacrosse: Double Dubs in the Double Digits

MATHEW LIU
FRIDAY 4/11
Andover
Cushing
WEDNESDAY 4/

Andover

Austin Prep

Boys Lacrosse (6-1) earned
back-to-back victories last week,
defeating Cushing Academy
(Cushing) 11-3 on Friday and shut-
ting out Austin Prepatory School
(Austin Prep) 19-0 on Wednes-
day. With these commanding
wins, the team continues to build
momentum heading into a stretch
of high-stakes matchups.

In Friday night’s matchup
against Cushing, Andover dom-
inated both ends of the field,
staying aggressive on offense and
composed on defense. Captain
Max Herbison ’25 complimented
the team’s ability to be consistent
during faceoffs, which proved
pivotal in maintaining possession
and applying pressure throughout
the games.

“We really excelled at face-offs
— we won well over 50 percent,
which was huge for getting the
ball into the offensive zone. We
also did a great job limiting fast
break goals and transition plays,’
said Herbison.

Hank Ferguson ’25 defends against Cushing opponent in 11-3 victory.

Goalie Paul Harrison ’25 also
mentioned the pivotal role fa-
ceoffs played in the game and
how, through the faceoff guys, the
team was able to control posses-
sion and gain the upper hand in
the game from the start.

“Our faceoff guys — Jude Scar-
borough ’25 and Alex Dimnaku
27 — dominated the draw all
game, and when you control pos-
session like that, it’s a huge advan-
tage,” said Harrison.

An end-of-quarter goal gave

Andover a boost of momentum
and underscored the team’s
sharpness in key moments. With
high energy from the start, the
squad entered the game with con-
fidence but stayed grounded.

“We were excited going in, it
was a Friday night game under
the lights, and the energy was
high. But we know any team can
beat us any day if we’re not locked
in) said Herbison.

A 19-0 shutout during the
game against Austin Prep on

M.STOUT/THE PHILLIPIAN

Wednesday reflected not only the
team’s offensive dominance but
also the contributions from every
part of the field — including de-
fense. Dimnaku pointed to several
standout performances from the
game.

“Jacob Gourley [‘26] really
took advantage of his minutes —
scored three goals, all in the sec-
ond half, and William Ogle [‘26]
was a steady presence on offense,’
said Dimnaku.

Wednesday’s game gave op-

portunities for all players to play
more across the lineup, and many
capitalized. Defensive _ players
made their mark, even scoring
some goals themselves to get their
first points of the season.

“Our defenders really got in-
volved. John Bancone [’25], one of
our short-stick defensive middies,
scored his first goal of the season.
Max Herbison got his first or sec-
ond, and Jack Farrell [26], a de-
fenseman, also got his first. It was
awesome to see,” said Dimnaku.

While the win was decisive,
players are staying focused on the
road ahead. With tougher oppo-
nents looming, the team used the
game as preparation — both men-
tally and tactically.

“This game didn’t really have
any importance — it was more like
a mental reset. We’ve got winna-
ble games coming up, but it’s go-
ing to come down to our mindset
and preparation,” said Dimnaku.

Looking ahead, Andover is
preparing for a crucial part of the
season, with matchups against
nationally ranked teams on the
horizon. The focus now turns to
consistency, composure, and exe-
cution.

“Our goal is to win — and win
big — every time we step on the
field. We want to compete with
the best and prove we belong in
that conversation,” said Harrison.

Boys Lacrosse will travel to
Choate on Saturday for its next
match.

WEDNESDAY 4/

Boys Volleyball (6-0) over-
came Phillips Academy Exeter
(Exeter) in a stunning, come-back
victory. Andover took the first set
but dropped the next two, then
stormed back in the fourth and
fifth to upset Exeter. Exception-
al performances from Jeremy
Woodley ’26, Captain Arthur Wu
’25, and Captain Inti Stephenson
’25 led the team to its first victory
against Exeter in two years, while
also continuing the team’s six-
game win streak.

Down two sets to one, Ando-
ver needed to rally for a come-
back. Wu explained the mentality
switch among the team as it de-
cided to take more risks and push
themselves until the end.

“When we were up by one
[set], we felt good and confident
with our swings. In the next two
sets, you could see that we were
being safe. In the fourth set, we

just decided to go all out — real-
ly hit the ball, crank it when we
could, and go for it. We pushed
ourselves when the game was on
the line,’ said Wu.

Will Oh ’26 also describes the
refocusing and mentality of An-
dover coming into the fourth and
fifth sets. With nothing left to lose
and it’s back to the wall, the team
also brought confidence and com-
posure, changing the tide of the
match.

“Our mentality was that we
had nothing to lose after that third
set. Because of that mentality, we
needed to focus and boost our
confidence, bringing that ego and
confidence with us. That boost
of confidence allowed us to play
with intensity and ultimately win
the game,” said Oh’26.

Wu highlighted some players
instrumental to Andover’s ral-
ly, specifically praising Brandon
Fu ’25 and Stephenson for their
ability to adapt and take control
during crucial moments through
the five-set thriller.

“Brandon stepped into that
role whenever needed, especial-
ly coming cold off the bench and
having to come in right away. He
did a great job. Another person
who stood out was my Co-Cap-
tain, Inti. He was always there for

Will Oh ’26 serves in final sets to comeback against Exeter.

the ball, which was important in
prolonging points and keeping the
ball alive,” said Wu.

Going into the fifth set and
needing energy, Ren Oh’28 shout-
ed out Woodley for his strong per-
formance that sealed the game for
Andover.

“I want to highlight Jeremy’s

performance in the last set. We
were up a few points because
we got a couple of aces and had
smart plays. We started having a
little trouble, and they began to
catch up. We started setting Jere-
my more, and he just kept hitting
them. He kept coming, and that
was the energy we needed to take

back that final set and steal the
game,” said Oh.

Andover and Exeter are sto-
ried rivals. Against Exeter, Ando-
ver has been in a drought for over
two years. Oh ’28 emphasized the
significance of this victory and the
confidence boost it instills for fu-
ture games.

“Beating Exeter in any sport is
big. We are rival schools, so the
competition between us is at a
higher level compared to other
schools. Especially since Exeter is
the closest level to us in the NEP-
SAC [New England Prepartory
School Athletic Council] league,
winning today was a big victory.
It set the tone. We’re 6-0 now, and
when we go against them later in
the season — if we get to the fi-
nals, which I think we will — and
we have to go against them, we'll
have that slight edge on them. I
am looking forward to that. Today
was a big win, not only because of
the history but also because Ex-
eter is a very good team, and we
will play them in the future,’ said
Oh’28.

Boys Volleyball will go to North
Andover High School for its next
match on Wednesday.

the trials, the team had struggled
with inclement weather, inhibit-
ing its ability to practice outside
consistently. According to return-
ing member Matt Robinson ’27,
the season has been productive
yet challenging, especially with
many new teammates.

“It’s been a good season so far.
Last week was a bit tough because
it was pretty cold, so we couldn’t
go outside like we normally
would... We have a relatively new
team. There are three freshmen
on the team, so it’s a really good
team, and it’s alot of fun to be with
them,’ said Robinson.

Frank Hu ’26 echoed some of
the challenges regarding weath-
er and the training the team has
been putting in to find success.

“We've had a lot of new peo-
ple coming over, and we’ve been
training really well in preparation.
One thing that has been stopping
us from reaching our full potential
is the weather. However, overall,
it’s been really nice. It’s my second
year on the cycling team. I biked a
lot over the summer, and it’s nice
to see my work start paying off”

said Hu.

Building up to the race, the

team began to practice positions
on the bikes to be aerodynam-
ic and receive the fastest times.
The team experimented with its
positioning throughout the trial,
ultimately leading to favorable
outcomes.
“We've been practicing many
different things, but most impor-
tantly, in our time trial, it helps a
ot when you're in an aerodynam-
ic position. So we've all been ex-
perimenting with what position-
ing is comfortable for us to help us
go as fast as possible. It isn’t neces-
sarily something that the coaches
have been focusing on, but I think
that really paid off today,’ said
Robinson.

Although this was the team’s
first race, David Porto ’26 noted

the different format for this race.
In cycling, most races occur as a
team; however, this was an indi-
vidual race.

“The race was an individual
time trial, so it was only you out
on the road. In most other races,
you're allowed to be with other
team members, riding in a pack,
but this was more of a solo race, so
it depended more on how you did,
and the scoring was based on your
time,” said Porto

Despite many good _place-
ments, including new member
Eddie Marrero ’28 placing fourth,
the weather remained a constant
factor. However the team re-
mained positive and encouraged
each other to keep improving, ac-
cording to Hu.

“The main downer was that it
was cold and windy, so everyone

was bundled up and trying to stay
warm. However, every time we
saw someone in blue come around
the bend and do another lap, we
were all cheering, and it was a re-
ally supportive environment. For
a lot of people, before the race,
we were nervous because we had
three or four newbies today com-
pete in their first race. For most
returners, it was business as usual,
just getting back into the swing of
things,” said Hu.

All Gender Cycling will race
another Individual Time Trial
next Wednesday.

MATHEW LIU

The Cycling Team is pow-
ered by more than just gears,
it’s driven by the thoughtful
leadership of co-captain Da-
vid Porto ’26. Together with
his co-captain Emily Wu ’25,
they’ve fostered a team iden-
tity rooted in support, connec-
tion, and helping athletes of
all experience levels thrive.

For Porto, stepping into a
leadership role didn’t come
out of nowhere, it came from
the influence of the captains
before him.

“There wasn’t this dramat-
ic moment where I thought, ‘I
want to lead, it just came from
seeing how much those older
riders cared. People like Yas-
mine Tazi [’24] made the team
feel like a family, not just a
group of athletes. Now, I try to
do that, checking in with peo-
ple, staying after to help out,
making sure no one feels left
behind,” said Porto.

Whether he’s _ chatting
during warm-ups or helping
a teammate catch back up to
the pack during a group ride,
Porto’s leadership is grounded

Co-Captain David Porto Leads All-Gender

in steady, small moments that
build trust. He believes it’s
these quiet connections that
hold the team together, espe-
cially on long rides where si-
lence can kill the mood. Frank
Hu ’26, a returning rider, said
Porto’s guidance is especially
noticeable on race days, when
nerves run high.

COURTESY OF DAVID PORTO

“David is the kind of per-
son who notices when some-
one looks unsure and steps
in without making a big deal.
Before a time trial, he’ll walk
you through the course and
make sure you know the
plan. And during the race, he
doesn’t crack under pressure.
I was chasing him down today,

and instead of panicking, he
kicked into another gear. That
energy’s contagious,” said Hu.
While Porto’s leadership
leans towards a_ technical
and composed approach, Wu
brings warmth and ease, al-
lowing the co-captains to lead
dynamically and work effec-
tively as a pair of leaders.
Because the team often
splits into groups for outdoor
rides, the co-captains divide
and conquer. One leads a
group tackling longer climbs
while the other manages pac-
ing on flatter routes, ensuring
all riders, from seasoned rac-
ers to first-timers, get individ-
ual attention. Jasjit Hargun ’27
remembers feeling intimidat-
ed at first but says the captains
made all the difference.
“David was the first upper-
classman I noticed. He worked
like a varsity athlete, super
serious, focused, intense,
but then he cracked a joke
and made the whole ride feel
lighter. And Emily made me
feel like I’d been on the team
forever. She checked in every
day, remembered details from
conversations, it really helped
me settle in,” said Hargun.
The captains act as crucial

April 18, 2025

bridges between the riders
and the coaching staff, helping
advocate for their teammates’
well-being. Hargun spoke
about how the captains were
able to discuss training with
the coaches on the team’s be-
half.

“At the start of the season,
some of us were struggling
with how hard the training
was. We talked to the captains,
and they passed it onto the
coaches. Since then, we’ve had
more check-ins, and people
are feeling heard. That kind
of leadership really matters,”
said Hargun.

Now, with championship
races looming, Porto hopes to
bring home results, but more
importantly, to leave a legacy
if that be from the race itself
or the friends made because
of it.

“I want us to win Boys B
this year — that’s a big goal.
But what matters just as much
is that everyone finds some-
thing meaningful here, wheth-
er that’s the thrill of a sprint
or the friendships you make
riding side by side. I want peo-
ple to walk away loving this
sport,” said Porto.

All-Gender Cycling Co-Captain Emily Wu ’25

Creates Community Through Funny Stories and Expert Advice

THIAGO JOLLON

Two-year Co-Captain Em-
ily Wu ’25 inspires camarade-
rie and community in the An-
dover Cycling team. With 13
players, the program is inten-
tionally small, which Wu be-
lieves fosters a greater sense
of bonding and intimacy be-
tween teammates.

Wu explained her journey as
a cyclist from the bike-friend-
ly city of Beijing to the road
courses of Andover. Originally
introduced to the sport by her
father, she remembered how a
fellow cross-country runner at
Andover helped convince Wu
to join the Cycling team as a
new Lower.

“I started cycling
with my dad because he was
an avid road cyclist. ’m from
Beijing, and since Beijing is
a great bike city, I did casu-
al road cycling all the time.
When I came to Andover, I re-
alized there was a competitive
team... Last year’s captain was
my cross country teammate,
and she was the one who per-
suaded me, saying, ‘Hey, cy-
cling is a great sport, and it’s
super tight-knit’ Everyone [on
the team] has a lot of fun, and

road

it’s a very inclusive and inti-
mate community,” said Wu.

Wu prioritizes the physical
well-being of her teammates
as much as team community.
Matt Robinson ’27 recalled
how, when newer team mem-
bers were still adapting to
biking and struggling to keep
up, Wu intervened with the
coaches to reduce the length
of their workout to ease the
recovery process.

“She’s not afraid to go talk
to the coaches or even polite-
ly criticize them to help the
team. There was an instance
a few weeks ago, where some
new team members were
having a hard time with the
amount of biking, and their
egs were really tired. We were
supposed to do a workout, but
Emily went and talked to our
coaches to ask if we could
have a lighter workout to en-
sure they recovered well,” said
Robinson.

Robinson continued,
“Building off that story, I
joined the team last year as a
Junior. I was one of two Ju-
niors, and the only person I
knew on the team was Emily.
She was really nice, introduc-
ing me to [the team]. During
training sessions, even before
she was captain, she ensured

we always went around and
told each other our names and
everything.”

Eddy Marrero ’28 spoke
about his experience as a new
biker on the team and how
Wu has supported him social-
ly and technically. While Wu
contributes to the team’s ca-
maraderie, she also gives help-
ful pointers on the bike.

Marrero said, “[Emily has
welcomed me] with her kind-
ness and by being so sup-

portive and saying ‘Hey, how
are you?’ every day. There is
a sense of community that
she inspires and brings to the
team, and it has helped me
feel more connected with my
teammates. There is some jok-
ing around, making everything
funny and being able to laugh
together. When we are riding
around the Andover course,
we split up into groups of
three. I was in her group one
day, and I was lagging behind,

and she was following behind
me and gave me tips that really
helped me out, so it made me
feel better about my biking.”
Wu talked about how to
deal with the risks of the race
course, a lesson which she
earned the hard way. During
her first season on the team,
speeding into a downhill turn
caused Wu and a teammate to
crash, breaking Wu’s collar-
bone and ending her season
prematurely. The takeaway:
hit the brakes before you hit
the pavement.

“T learned [how to man-
age risks on the race course]
the hard way. My first year, I
broke my collarbone during a
race because I didn’t hit the
brakes during a tight turn.
It was downhill, and it was a
rainy day... It was the fourth
or fifth lap, and I crashed,
and a teammate crashed into
me. I was out for the season.
That’s when I realized brakes
are really important... The
sport has an inherent risk to
it, so the emphasis is on taking
care of each other and mak-
ing sure each other [is] safe
on the road... This makes the
team very collaborative [and]
it feels like a family,” said Wu.

All-Gender Ultimate Frisbee Dominates against Masconomet

AUDREY BAETEN-RUFFO

WEDNESDAY 4/16

Masconomet

On Wednesday, All-Gender
Ultimate Frisbee’s Open team
played Masconomet Ultimate
at Home in a decisive victory.
The victory marked its first
win this season, with only
one previous tie by the Girls
and Non-Binary (GNB) team
on Wednesday, April 9 against
Cambridge Rindge and Latin
School.

The GNB team was also
scheduled to play on Wednes-
day against Winchester. It
was canceled due to a lack of
healthy players, as explained
by Ibu Hada ’25.

“There are a lot of peo-
ple either sick or injured on
our team right now so we
had to tell the other team we
couldn’t do it. We aren’t hav-

ing practice or anything, but
some girls went out to the
field and did some throwing.
It was a totally optional situa-
tion,” said Hada.

For the Open team, windy
conditions were a focal point
of its preparations for the
game. Its warm up leading up
facing Masconomet focused
on acclimating players to the

unusual conditions, accord-
ing to Dean Yang ’27.

“Since [Tuesday] we knew
four game against Mas-
conomet] was going to be a
very windy game, which af-
fects us a lot in Ultimate. So
during warmups, we focused
on short throws, especially in
the upwind direction, helping
us get an early lead because

we could throw upwind and
the other team really couldn’t.
It’s really important to be
able to throw everywhere in
Ultimate,” said Yang.

The Open team has dra-
matically improved its game-
play from last season, mainly
due to returning players’ ex-
perience. Eric Wang ’25 high-
lighted the team’s work at
integrating strategic and effi-
cient play.

“We've been working on
improving our overall game-
play this season. Last season,
most of our players were new,
so we spent a lot of time learn-
ing the basics of the sport.
This season, we are working
on playing more as a team.
For example, on defense, we
are working on switches to
be more efficient or poach-
ing the throwing lanes,” said
Wang.

Ultimate centers around
strong sportsmanship. For his
communication and leader-
ship, Yang praised Co-Cap-
tain Fumi Kimura ’25 for ex-
emplifying such ideals.

“For all of the on-field

calls, [Kimura] was really lev-
el-headed and he made sure
not to elevate the situation.
He [is] a really great commu-
nicator and probably the rea-
son why we didn’t have a lot
of conflicts during the game...
[a] great spirit of the game,”
said Yang.

Wang explained that as
Ultimate’s season continues,
Seniors remain committed to
amplifying the culture of Ul-
timate, specifically pertaining
to Andover.

“I remember when I joined
Ultimate all of the players
were always happy to help me
throw and kept the energy up
throughout practice. I want
to help maintain this positive
environment and team cul-
ture so that future members
of the program will have the
same great experience that I
did,” said Wang.

The Open team will play St.
Sebastian’s at Home next Fri-
day; GNB will play in a tour-
nament in Maine on Sunday,
May 4.

THIAGO JOLLON

This offseason, the baseball
world saw one of the most antic-
ipated free agencies since, well,
last season. After much deliber-
ation, free-agent superstar Juan
Soto swapped the New York Yan-
kees for their crosstown rivals
and signed a shocking, 15-year,
$765,000,000 contract with the
Mets. On face value, this is a mas-
sive win for the Mets, which are
known throughout the league as
perennial losers. It probably is;
outbidding your biggest rivals for
their player, adding one of the best
hitters in baseball to a lineup that
almost went to the World Series
last year, and locking him up for
15 years is a dream scenario. How-
ever, as a lifelong (long-suffering)
Mets fan, I’m not convinced. His-
tory and heartbreak have taught
me that the Mets are never a sure
bet, unless you are the owner and
have some inside information.

There are several reasons for
my cynical outlook. First, the ex-
pectations for Juan Soto and, by
extension, the Mets, this season
are stratospheric. The Mets love
to play metaphorical limbo with
expectations. My first baseball
memory is watching Eric Hosmer
of the Kansas City Royals slide
home and score the tying run in
the ninth inning of Game 5 of the
2015 World Series. The Royals
would go on to win that game and
the World Series, crushing any
hope that the Mets would win it
all. After that season, prospects
were high for the Mets. There
was an exciting young pitching
staff with pitchers like Matt Har-
vey and Noah Syndergaard, who
gained the monikers Thor and
The Dark Knight, and my naive,
six-year-old self thought that it
was only up from there. Right?
Wrong. The following season saw
the Mets top their division but get

Juan Soto Will Fail

swept 3-0 in the Wild Card game
against the San Francisco Giants.
That was the last time the Mets
even sniffed the playoffs in the
2010s. Disappointing season fol-
lowed disappointing season as the
Mets went through 4 managers,
saw a manager fired for sexual
harassment, had their star player
get injured playing golf and being
chased by a wild boar, and wasted
the prime years of two-time Cy
Young Winner Jacob deGrom.
The madness seemed to stop
when the ethically ambiguous
venture capitalist Steve Cohen
bought the team in 2020. His
spending power saw the signings
of marquee players like Francisco
Lindor and Edwin Diaz, which
led to the Mets winning 101 games
in 2022, making their first playoff

appearance since 2016. However,
despite winning 101 games and
leading the division for almost
the entirety of the season, in the
final week, the Mets’ luck turned
for the worse. In the final series
of the season, the Mets faced the
second-place Atlanta Braves. The
Braves swept the Mets, allowing
Atlanta to take first place, leaving
the Mets to the Wild Card. Once
again, the Mets bowed out in the
Wild Card, producing only one hit
in the deciding game against the
Padres. Once again, the bar was
high for next season, and once
again, they would fall short.

The 2023 season was a dump-
ster fire. Trouble began before the
season started. Star reliever Ed-
win Diaz tore his UCL celebrating
a victory during the preseason

ANGELA GUO/THE PHILLIPIAN

World Baseball Classic and was
out for the season. That was the
death knell for the season. Injury
and inconsistent play plagued the
Mets, causing them to trade away
star players at the deadline. The
Mets finished the season sitting in
4th place in the division, 29 games
out of first place. This was a bit-
ter disappointment compared to
the successful regular season in
2022. 2024 looked to be more of
the same, as the Mets started the
season 0-5 and boos were heard
ringing out around an empty Citi
Field. However, the Mets got hot
in the second half of the season
and sneaked into the final wild
card spot. They then shocked ev-
erybody by making a miracle run
to the National League Champi-
onship Series, where they fell to

the eventual champions, the L.A.
Dodgers. Expectations could nev-
er be higher for the Mets, and, as
we have seen time and time again,
the Mets never perform under
this type of pressure.

Adding to the Mets’ chron-
ic underperformance, the Mets
have experience signing players
to massive, multi-year contracts,
few of which have succeeded. You
may have heard of Bobby Bonil-
la Day, the day in July when the
Mets pay Bobby Bonilla, a play-
er who hasn’t swung a bat since
2001, 24 years ago, over a million
dollars in back pay. That’s because
the Mets signed him to an exor-
bitant contract, which he did not
live up to. The Mets bought him
out, but they still had to pay the
rest of his gigantic contract, which
is why the Mets will pay Bobby
Bonilla a million bucks a year un-
til 2035, when he'll be 72 years
old. There is a precedent for these
large contracts not working out
for the Mets. Soto will be 42 when
his contract expires in 2040, but
until then, he’ll make an average
of $51,000,000 a year. Of course,
Soto has his merits, being one of
the most consistent hitters in the
MLB since debuting as a teen-
ager in 2018, winning five Silver
Sluggers, being selected to four
All-Star games, and finishing sec-
ond in MVP voting in 2021. The
sheer magnitude of his contract
causes one to wonder how he'll
ever live up to it. This season, he’s
been lackluster compared to his
high standard, batting a measly
.250 with just six extra-base hits
in the first three weeks of the sea-
son. The massive pressure on Soto
and the haplessness of the team
he represents mean that Soto will
inevitably fall short. “Ya Gotta Be-
lieve,” say the Mets fans, but this
Mets fan will believe it when he
sees it.

On Thursday, Girls Soft-

in a shutout. It beat Bucking-

(BB&N) on Friday; on Wednes-
day, though, it fell to St. Paul’s.

Mila Fan ’28 highlighted the
importance of leadership from
Co-Captain Emerson Buckley
’25, who maintained the team’s
morale during its tough game
against St. Paul’s.

“Emerson gave a pep talk in
the huddle near the end of the
game. She basically said, ‘if you
don’t feel confident when you
go up to bat, then don’t go up at
all’ I think that mentality was
actually really good for us, be-
cause it brought us together,”
said Fan.

Against St. Paul’s, cold con-
ditions affected play from start
to finish. Despite the weather’s
challenges, pitcher Audrey Go-
tha ’28 and catcher Gabi Potter
’27 performed especially well,
according to Sydney Moore ‘28.

“Our pitcher Audrey had a
really great performance. She
did awesome to stay out there
even in the really cold weather
and just kept going, even when
it was really tough. And then
huge props to our catcher Gabi,
who did an absolutely amazing
job. She stayed out there in the
cold when catching the ball,
especially when it’s coming in
fast and can hurt a lot. I would
say Gabi was the star of the
game,” said Moore.

Players on the field, though,
were never alone. Notably,
Moore explained how the team
coordinated jacket-swaps_ to
keep the players on the field
warm.

“During the games we are
always talking on the bench
and cheering each other on,
trying our best to lift each oth-
er up even if we are down or we
are upset with ourselves. We
are also always offering to help
everyone. During the game we

Boys and Girls Outdoor Track & Field Defeating
Everyone and the Cold Weather with a “Warm” Spirit

ASHLEY SUH

On Wednesday, Girls and Boys
Outdoor Track opened its season
against St. Paul’s, Concord Acad-
emy, and Montrose following two
canceled meets. Despite strong
winds and cold conditions, An-
dover’s athletes delivered strong
wins.

Michelle Onyeka ’27 compli-
mented Arashi Hunter PG’25 and
Co-Captain Naima Reid ’25 on
their races, both running against
strong opponents.

“I want to point out Arashi —
he’s a [Post-Graduate student] —
and Naima Reid— she’s a senior.
This was the first time I ever saw
Arashi run an 800-Meter Dash
and his strides are crazy and he
was so strong and you could see
the wind because we had like
tail wind, but when you were go-
ing down the back stretch it was
horrible because you’re running
directly against the wind and
Arashi was strong the whole time.
I don’t know how he felt about it
personally, but watching it was so
incredible. He put such a big gap
between him and everyone else,”
said Onyeka.

Onyeka continued, “Second-
ly, Naima did the 4x100-Meter,
4x200-Meter and 4x400-Me-
ter. She did everything and she
cooked. In the 4x100-Meter she
had to run the back stretch and
against the wind. Then in the
400-Meter, having to do a full lap,
a full sprint, that’s really rough,

Denzil Pierre PG ’25 competes in long jump event.

especially when you know youre
gonna get hit by the wind. So, I
thought those two really stood out
to me personally.”

On the other hand, Caitlin Ly
’27 commended Sarah Bae ’26 and
Ela Budzinski ’28 for their excel-
lent form and effort throughout
each race, highlighting their wins
and awesome composure during
the meet.

“I definitely would say Sar-
ah Bae [stood out]: she ran the
100-Meter hurdles and_ the
300-Meter hurdles and she got
first in the 100-Meter hurdles and
then second in the 300-Meter
hurdles. She had a really good per-
formance in the 100-Meter Dash

and she worked really hard and
she came out with a win. I also
think Ela, who ran the 400-Meter
Dash, did a really good job. She
maintained strong form through-
out and it was a great way to open
the season,” said Ly.

While the cold weather was
definitely a challenge, Murathime
Daisley ’26 emphasized the team’s
“warm” and supportive atmo-
sphere that gave each player con-
fidence to challenge their limits.

“Despite the cold weather, it
was a very warm atmosphere
between the team and in terms
of the support that the team was
giving each other. I think a lot of
athletes showed out today and I

A.PIZZI/THE PHILLIPIAN

think everyone did because it was
just super cold. I can’t really pin-
point one person, but I think I saw
everyone challenge themselves
and embrace elements, which is
good,” said Daisley.

Congratulating this week’s
successes and looking forward to
the next week, Daisley, a mid-dis-
tance athlete, corroborated both
the Girls and Boys 4x400-Meter
races. She also gave insight into
the team’s training and workouts
in preparation for its upcoming
meets.

“Both of the 4x400-Meter
teams swept, which was good.
They were by a. significant
amount, which was fun to see. It

was exciting to see everyone com-
pete for the first time. I think now
that we have some times down
just trying to work on what we
thought our weaknesses were for
everyone, that’s gonna be differ-
ent. I’m excited to see how we’re
gonna do under ideal conditions
because I think everyone did pret-
ty well under some pretty tough
conditions today, so that’s excit-
ing,” said Daisley.

Similarly, Ly, a sprinter, de-
scribed the team’s goals for next
week’s meets and how the team is
currently training to reach these
goals.

“Last week we were doing
some good workouts, getting the
work in for our Saturday meet,
but then it got canceled. So then
this week we were just working
on maintaining what we built
upon from last week. So we did
some lighter stuff and then also
technical work before the meet.
This meet was definitely colder,
so we didn’t get the best perfor-
mances, but I think for working
towards the next meets, I believe
it’s next Wednesday, so it’ll be a
bit warmer, but just maintaining
that good energy that we have and
keeping up the hard work in prac-
tices as well as working on form
and other things like that,’ said Ly.

Girls and Boys Outdoor Track
& Field will face Austin Prep and
Landmark School at home next
Wednesday.

This Saturday, Girls Tennis (5-
0) faced Winsor in a hard-fought
match, ultimately ending in a vic-
tory and extending its win-streak.
On Wednesday, it defeated St.
Paul’s in a dominant sweep.

Dreary weather conditions ini-
tially drove down the team’s mo-

rale, but, according to Co-Captain
Lena Ciganer-Albeniz ’25, Head
Coach Katy Lambson empha-
sized high energy on Saturday.

“The week going up to [the
match], our coach really empha-
sized energy and staying hyped
throughout practice. So even
though it was pouring outside
and really late and really long and
grueling, we went in with a lot of
energy and that did us really well,”
said Ciganer-Albeniz.

According to Mercan Draman
’26, following a tough loss in her
first set, Kendra Tomala’26 main-
tained her composure to finish the
match and defeat her opponent.

“Kendra’s match — she’s our
number one singles — she was up
in the first set by a lot, but then she
ended up losing the first set. And
then she won the second set by
a really close margin and the tie-
break was really fun and exciting
to watch,” said Draman.

Evelyn Kung ’26 also empha-
sized Tomala’s performance
whose match was much longer
than expected. Furthermore,
Kung praised Lara Madan ’27
who she hadn’t played doubles
with much before.

“My doubles partner, Lara, re-
ally stood out because it was our
first time playing doubles togeth-
er and we did really well. And,
also my teammate, Kendra Tama-
la, she played a three hour match.
She lost the first set, came back to
win the second, and then won ina
tiebreaker. And her match literal-
ly lasted three hours, which is just
insane,” said Kung.

According to Ciganer-Albeniz,
on Wednesday against St. Pauls,
each team member was seeded
one placer higher due to Toma-
la, the team’s first-seeded player,
inability to play. Still, the team
secured wins in all of its singles
matches.

“Because we were missing our
number one, Kendra, because she
had the flu, we had to play a very
modified lineup for both, but sin-
gles wasn’t much different. We
basically just bumped everyone
one up. That was nice that ev-
erybody won in their respective
single matches even though ev-
erybody was playing one position
higher than they usually play,’
said Ciganer-Albeniz.

Draman emphasized the
team’s ability to keep energy lev-
els high in a moment where every
teammate was successful in their
matches.

“We were just continuing to
do what we’ve been doing for the
past week and a half. We kept up
the energy that we had in Winsor,
even though St. Paul’s is a worse
team than Winsor, we were still
very hyped about our matches”,
said Draman.

Kung predicted that the team’s

upcoming practices will focus on
regaining strength as illness pass-
es through the team. Additionally,
it will work on improving its dou-
bles strategy.

“Everybody’s sick, so we're try-
ing to focus on rebuilding right
now. I think we’re gonna be doing
a lot more doubles work because
those three points [that were lost]
at the beginning are so crucial. I
think we might try out different
formations, like we did last week.
Maybe we’re gonna do Aussie this
week,” said Kung.

Girls Tennis will play at Cho-
ate and Deerfield on Saturday and
Wednesday, respectively.

Boys Tennis: Twenty Game Win-Streak Broken

WEDNESDAY 4/1

Andover

St. Paul’s

On Friday, Boys Tennis (4-1)
overcame Noble & Greenough
(Nobles) in a narrow victory;
though, it fell to Roxbury Latin in
a close loss on Monday. Despite
this loss, the team rebounded in
a commanding win against St.
Paul’s on Wednesday. Injuries
to key players plagued the team
and contributed to its loss against
Roxbury Latin, breaking a twenty
match win streak.

On Wednesday, Boys Tennis
defeated Nobles in a competi-
tive series of matches. Co-Cap-
tain Kevin Niu ’25 praised Avery
Zheng ’25 for his match-winning
performance and _ discussed

Jacob Pletka ’27 prepares to serve against Nobles.

Zheng’s reliability.

“In terms of key players, during
Nobles, I would say Avery Zheng
[25]. He just never loses — he’s
a very consistent player. I can al-
ways look towards his court to get
aconfidence boost because I know
he’s winning by so much. Against
Nobles, we were tied 3-3, and Av-
ery was the tie-breaking match.
He won very convincingly, so it
wasn’t even that nerve-wracking
for us. He’s always someone we
can rely on and count on to win,”
said Niu.

Jeff Shen ’26 described the
difficulties of the team’s matches
against Roxbury Latin. Despite
winning against Nobles on Friday,

Shen believed the team was still
recovering from the narrow vic-
tory. Furthermore, Shen also be-
lieved the long drive to Roxbury
Latin may have affected the play-
ers abilities.

“It’s tough to be right on your
game as soon as you hit the court
— especially in a sport like this,
where you’re expected to be sharp
right from the start. Despite that,
we had some moments that real-
ly helped us get back on our feet.
Two of our top three singles play-
ers lost their first sets really quick-
ly, but both were able to bounce
back. I was able to take the second
set from my opponent, and our
number one, Chase Burke [25],

rebounded after a really fast loss
in the first set. To overcome those
challenges and take the second set
with some great points was huge,”
said Shen.

Shen also explained the men-
tal aspect of tennis and expressed
optimism despite the team’s loss
against Roxbury Latin.

“If you asked most tennis
players, they’ll tell you that ten-
nis is a mental sport. It’s really,
really tough to be alone in that
sport—it’s very different. I also
play soccer for the boys’ team,
but it’s a completely different at-
mosphere. You're on the court on
your own, and sometimes these
thoughts can get to you. So, for the
next team, we have to remember
that our first loss in two years is
nothing to be concerned about.
We played well. I’m proud of the
team,” said Shen.

Bouncing back from its loss
against Roxbury Latin, Jacob Plet-
ka ’27 described the team’s mind-
set heading into its match against
St. Paul’s. Despite the cold weath-
er and having many teammates
injured, the rest of the team was
motivated to win.

“I would say that, even though
we didn’t have three of our main
guys, we still brought the energy
in the match. Definitely, in that
cold weather, everybody’s body
gets sort of stiff and stuff. But I say
that Avery who played number
three, got his task done first. He
put his hands together, clapped
them, and got off the court. I guess
that just motivated the rest of us

to get it done as quickly and effi-
ciently as possible,’ said Pletka.

From the team’s first loss this
season to Roxbury Latin, Niu
spoke on the elements that the
team will focus on addressing. On
top of communicating the need
for the team to intensify its focus
during practice and warmups,
Niu also commented on the issue
of having numerous players in-
jured.

“Also, creating a more consis-
tent lineup for our matches would
really help. I feel like in a lot of our
matches, some of us aren’t there
or some of us are injured. So may-
be taking better care of our bodies,
making sure to stretch and do ev-
erything we need to, would help
us have a full lineup going into
each match. When we do, we have
a good chance in every match we
play. And I think it would help
with team dynamic and lineups
too—knowing where you're play-
ing and who you're playing dou-
bles with, so we’re not switching
things around every time. I thin
creating that consistency, which
we had last year, would be very
useful going forward—especially
after we just lost to Roxbury Lat-
in,’ said Niu.

Boys Tennis will travel to Bel-
mont Hill on Friday. On Saturday,
it will face Deerfield at Home, and
on Wednesday, it will play Groton
in an away game.

ASHLEY SUH

Girls Lacrosse (5-1) had a suc-
cessful week, putting up two hard-
fought wins against Milton and St.
Paul’s. The win against St. Pauls
on Wednesday was especially a
memorable win after having lost
narrowly last year. This time, Girls
Lacrosse brought even more fight
and determination to come out
with the strong win.

Lily Loughlean ’27 highlights
the efforts of Ashley Dimnaku ’28,
Caroline Young ’26, Quiana Bell
’26 and Lola Aguirre ’26 across
the field throughout their game
against Milton, commenting on
their impressive plays and deter-
mination that stood out.

“Ashley Dimnaku definitely
stood out. She got three goals, and

THE PHILLIPIAN

Girls Lacrosse Dominates on the Field

with Two Wins Against Milton and St. Paul’s

she started our momentum by
scoring a lot because in the first
quarter it was tied zero-zero.

There wasn’t that much ac-
tion, but then she started scoring
and then everyone else started
scoring. I would also say Caro-
line Young, because she also got
some big goals that put us ahead.
There were some [good plays]
on defense with Quiana Bell and
Lola Aguirre. They’re just really
good at stepping in front of them
and stepping up and causing turn-
overs,” said Loughlean

Loughlean gave insight into
the preparation the team took be-
fore their game and areas in play
where they hope to work onas the
season commences as they will be
facing tougher teams later on.

“We watched the film from
last year because we beat them
in overtime last year, but it was
definitely like a closer game...
[Now] we’re definitely working
on defense. I would say working
together and communicating, be-
cause I feel that’s the key to good
defense. Then on offense, just
staying spread out and working
off the ball to create opportuni-
ties for people with the ball,” said
Loughlean.

Reflecting on their immense
win, Gracynn Hartley ’27 noted
the grit and strong effort put in
by Dimnaku, Bell, Lauren Herli-

hy ’25, Autumn Christian ’27, and
Charley Drouin ’25.

“We were at the end of the
game, the score was six-six and
we were tied. Autumn scored our
winning goal in the last two min-
utes and then off of the draw, Ash-
ley Dimnaku worked really hard
off of the draw to get the ball so
that St Paul’s wouldn’t come get
it back and score throughout the
game... Quiana always does a great
job on defense because she gets a
lot of interceptions and she’s al-
ways vocal on D [Defense]. She’s
such a leader,’ said Hartley

Adding on to Hartley’s kudos,
Ashley Dimaku ’28 applauded the
strong play of Herlihy and Bell
who helped the team come out
with a win.

“We felt great and we felt like
it was a very big achievement af-
ter our loss against Nobles, and
we still think there’s a lot to im-
prove and learn from the game.
Some athletes that really stood
out during the game were Lauren
and Quiana. Quiana was coming
up with ground balls and, Quiana
was playing great defense and
Lauren was taking good draws,’

April 18, 2025

said Dimnaku.

Hartley spoke about the team’s
energy that they carried through-
out and after the game.

“We felt pretty awesome. We
knew they were gonna be a tough
team going up against them...
They definitely were up to that
caliber and you know what, we
matched their energy and we
were able to give it back to them,”
said Hartley.

Dimnaku praised the team’s
work during the game, especial-
ly working as a team and imple-
menting trust in each other. She
also added what the team was
looking forward to working on
throughout the season.

“In the third quarter, we did a
really good job moving on offense,
moving off ball, and creating lanes
to drive. Another strength was
trusting one another on defense
[which led to] a lot of turnovers...
[In practice] we’ve been working
a lot on off-ball movement... Cre-
ating a very good offense with a
lot of momentum is something we
strive for)’ said Dimnaku.

Girls Lacrosse will travel to
Choate on Saturday, April 19.

All-Gender Golf with Convincing Wins on the

Varsity and JV side, Pushing Them to a Record of 6-1-1

EVA JACKSON

The All-Gender Golf Team en-
tered Wednesday’s matches with
momentum going from its victory
against Phillips Exeter Academy
last week. Both the Varsity and JV
squads came out on top, boosting
the team’s record and building
confidence before more signifi-
cant events later this month.

The team has started the sea-
son strong, winning most matches
by a wide margin. Captain Heyon
Choi’25 pointed to the team’s ear-
ly success and the high level of fo-
cus from both returning and new
players.

“The season has been off to
a good start. A lot of the match-
es that we have had, we’ve won.
When we did win, [they were]
pretty easy wins. A lot of people
are dialed in, and we have a lot of
strong new players on the team. I
am really excited to see how the
rest of the season goes,” said Choi.

Sebastian Montemayor ’27 hits an approach shot, aiding the team to
defeating Holderness and St. Marks in trimatch.

Sean Niu ’25 echoed that senti-
ment, attributing the team’s early
success to its depth and individu-
al ability. He also added that this
year especially, there is a special
pool of talented players on the
team.

“It’s just our individual talent.
Andover Golf has lucked out with

lots of really good individual tal-
ents, and that’s made our team
really, really deep this year,’ said
Niu.

Choi described how practice
usually consists of playing nine
holes, explaining that practice
gives an opportunity for players to
refine specific areas of their game.

“Most days we have been play-
ing nine holes, and if we can get
the chance, we go to driving rang-
es to dial in some of the things we
want to fix in our swing or our
short game,” said Choi.

The team has built strong
bonds through shared time off the
course. Through daily car rides to
practice or a match with a team
curated playlist, the team’s chem-
istry has been very strong this sea-
son.

“I have really enjoyed the car
rides to practice or our games. We
have a really close-knit team this
season, and it’s been really fun to
spend time with everyone and
laugh. We actually most recently
made a golf playlist on Spotify, and
it’s been exciting to listen to that
every time we travel,” said Choi.

Niu spoke about the shared de-
termination among players to go
out and perform and win. He also

mentioned how the team wants
to focus on being resilient and not
backing down after facing adver-
sity.

“We have been really fired up
recently, and we just want to go
out and win everything. That’s
kind of been our mentality. We’ve
been working toward that goal,
and we've been trying to adopt a
resilient mindset?’ said Niu.

Looking ahead, the team is
preparing for several key tourna-
ments — individual events for the
team that are separate from and
less team-oriented than match
play.

“We have a lot of big tourna-
ments ahead of us, including a
multi-day one. Some of the most
important ones will be the [Inde-
pendent International Invitation-
al (IID)] tournament, the Andover
Invitational, and for the girls, the
Pippy O’Connor [Independent
School Girls Golf Classic],’ said
Choi.

The team faces Proctor on
Wednesday and Brooks on Thurs-
day.

Last week, Baseball (4-2) be-
gan its three-day stretch of games
with two narrow losses to Dexter
Southfield School and Belmont
Hill. However, once returning
home for its game on Friday, the
team took a commanding 4-0 win
against Bridgton Academy (Bridg-
ton). They followed that up witha
dominant victory against Cushing
away this past Wednesday.

The team agrees that playing
away is harder, especially with

Baseball Returns from Tough Belmont Hill
Loss with Big Wins against Bridgton and Cushing

last week’s weather, which made
playing conditions unfavorable.
Michael Doherty ’27 noted that
the cold weather contributed to
its tough loss against Belmont
Hill.
“It’s still pretty early in the sea-
son. We were trying to figure out
our pitching lineup, and it was
freezing cold. They threw in a
pitcher we’ve never seen before,
and we were hitting them pretty
well, but they got a couple of hits,
and we fell apart. We stopped
hitting. We got cold quickly, and
we've struggled with away games,
but we bounced back pretty well,”
said Doherty.
The game was close through-
out, and players like Mikah Kry-
stofolski ’27 stepped up to the
challenge, singling twice. Doherty
also gave shoutouts to Michael
Gilligan ’26 and Luke Gallo ’25 for
their impressive performances.
“Luke Gallo had a big double
that caught us an RBI and got us
a run. Micah Krystofolski got a
huge hit in the first inning. He also
got a bump down for a hit, which
was also big. Micah performed
well. Michael Gilligan started the
game. I forgot how many innings
he went, but he stayed in for along
time and did well,” said Doherty.
The team faced Bridgton Acad-
emy at home to cap off the three-

day stretch. The game was high-
lighted by excellent all-around
play. Jacob Honor ’27 praised
Krystofolski and Jun Ahn ’27 for
their performances, calling Krys-
tofolski the MVP of the match.
“Micah pitched super well for
us. He was shut out during the
pitching. He threw six innings,
and he was locked in. We also
just had many big hits during the
game. It was great. Jun had a few

really nice hits, and we played this
game together all around,” said
Honor.

To begin its next stretch of
away games, four in a week, the
team faced Cushing. It was one
of the easier matches this season,
as Andover won 10-1. Here’s what
Miles O’Neil ’28 had to say about
the game.

“We jumped ahead early,
up 2-0 with Luke Gallo hitting

a home run. We kept adding
runs throughout the game, and
our pitchers did a great job. We
switched out pitching a lot and
had a bunch of guys throw out.
We also played great defense. Mi-
cah made an awesome play, and
we also hit well. We did every-
thing well overall,” said O’Neil.
For the Cushing game, Gal-
o and Krystofolski were again
praised for their performances.
For Krystofolski, despite his pre-
vious pitching excellence, O’Neil
praised him for his batting and
defense.
“Luke Gallo played well. He
had his second home run of the
year. Micah also played well. He
had a few hits, and he played great
on defense,” said O’Neil.

The team’s next match is a
double header against Worcester.
O’Neil noted that they will contin-
ue improving as its game against
Worcester draws nearer.

“We're gonna practice this
Thursday and Friday, but I’m not
sure what we’re gonna work on.
Probably hitting and pitching and
defense. We're just gonna keep on
trying to get better at everything,”
said O’Neil

The team will face Worcester
Academy away this Saturday.

Behind The Scenes: New Student Directors Take The Spotlight in Drama Labs

DANIEL ZHANG &
ELIAS JEON

Beneath the glow of stage
lights, the characters Agnes
and Virgil linger just off-
screen, suspended between
fiction and reality. The au-
dience watches with bated
breaths as they plead with
Pym, a meticulous film re-
storer, to alter the ending of
the movie and save them. Pym
must decide whether to help
them or leave with her hus-
band Gary for their anniver-
sary dinner, weighing their
fictional fate against her own
marriage.

Last Friday, Drama Labs
staged a mini production of
“Vinegar Syndrome,” directed
by Natalie Giancola ’28. De-
spite having just six rehearsal
sessions, the cast delivered a
remarkably cohesive perfor-
mance. In addition, Drama
labs brought “Paper and Inc”
to the stage, directed by Jean-
nie Kang ’28.

Giancola said, “I picked
this play because I thought
it did a really interesting job
of weaving together multi-
ple themes while still being a
short, ten-minute piece that’s
super fun to direct. It’s fun-
ny and engaging, but it also
plays with complex ideas, and
I really liked that. I’ve always
been interested in acting, I’ve
done multiple shows at Ando-
ver, and I wanted to try some-
thing new and step into a dif-

ferent role in theater.”

For actor Takunda Basvi
’28, who played the flustered
husband Gary in “Vinegar
Syndrome,” stepping into a
new role was both a challenge
and exciting milestone in her
acting journey.

“It felt great. It’s always
fun to play a different char-
acter, especially since Gary
is a male character. I got to
explore that and embody it,
which was really cool. I feel
like it adds to the range of
roles I’ve played, which is ex-

citing,” said Basvi.

However, this creative pro-
cess wasn’t without its obsta-
cles. Giancola pointed to the
distinctive set design and pe-
riod costuming as particularly
difficult, requiring innovative
solutions on a tight timeline.

“Costuming was a_ bit
tough; we wanted to get that
old-timey feel, which was
hard to put together. Also,
navigating the stage was
tricky, it’s uniquely shaped
with the audience on three
sides, so we had to adjust the

blocking to make everything
more dynamic. But I’m really
impressed with my cast, they
did such an amazing job put-
ting everything together so
quickly,” said Giancola.
Reflecting on her own di-
recting experience, Kang
shared the rewarding feeling
that followed the production.
Between audience enthusi-
asm and teamwork, Kang felt
proud of the show’s success.
“The outcome of the per-
formance, seeing everything
come together and seeing my

actors being proud of their
erformance. I always en-
joy audiences having fun and
feeling like they’re a part of
the performance, so seeing
that audience react to the
show was great,” said Kang.
This round of Drama Labs
also marked a unique shift in
Kang’s creative process, with
new challenges from her pre-
vious directing experience.
Kang moved forward with
determination, undeterred by
the differences.

“Natalie, who was my actor
ast time, was co-directing an-
other play, so that was fasci-
nating and also, we had I had
a different set of actors and a
script that I had not written
myself, so it was a little bit
more challenging trying to
understand what that writer
must have thought of when
writing the script,” said Kang.

As the lights dim and the
applause fades to a halt, both
young directors already have
their sights set on future en-
deavors. With a new year, the
directors are eager to wel-
come more students into the
fold.

“I would encourage every-
one to try out Drama Labs
because it is really an oppor-
tunity to get to know new
people, learn a little bit more
about acting and directing
and most importantly, having
fun because that is what Phil-
lips Academy is all about,”
said Kang.

Strung Together: Music, Friendship, and Purpose with the Dolphins String Quartet

DANIEL LIU &
CHARLIZE SOW

Last Friday, violinist Luke
Henderson ’21 returned to cam-
pus with the Dolphin String
Quartet, a chamber ensemble
based in New York. The group
hosted a concert, and on Satur-
day, they hosted a morning mas-
terclass in Falls Music Center
(Falls). These events not only fos-
tered artistic inspiration, but un-
derscored the ensemble’s broad-
ission of reimagining joy and
sibility in chamber music.

The Friday night concert
opened with Jessie Mon-
tegomery’s “Voodoo Dolls,’ a
contemporary work that set an
energetic tone for the rest of
the performance. The quartet
continued with Mozart’s String
Quartet in E-Flat Major, K. 428,
whose rustic charm and ele-
gant melodies provided a beau-
tiful contrast. Then, the group
brought warmth and energy to
the stage with a lively set of Ar-
menian folk songs, full of joyful,
nostalgic melodies that delighted
the audience.

“The composer was visiting
our school to teach and give a
concert, and we were asked to
choose one of her pieces. We
picked ‘Voodoo Dolls’ because
we loved the energy - it fits real-
ly well on a lot of programs,” said
violist James Preucil.

He continued, “Then we
played a Mozart quartet. We
knew we wanted to include
something by Mozart, and this
one felt like it fit our personality.
It’s in E-flat major, which gives it
a warmer, rustic character. After
that, we played Armenian folk
songs — those are always fun, easy

to program, and audiences love
them.”

The next morning, the quartet
hosted a masterclass for Ando-
ver’s student chamber groups,
hoping to inspire talented youth.
Violist Ryan Baek ’28 participat-
ed in the session, reflecting on
the emphasis on collaboration
and clear communication.

“T thought it’d be a great op-
portunity to work with some
really talented musicians, es-
pecially those with a lot more
experience in chamber music.
I really enjoyed hearing all the
suggestions from the musicians
in the quartet. They gave a lot of
insight into how the piece could
be interpreted, and it helped our
group improve as a whole. It was
the little details that made a big
difference, like how to make ev-
erything more cohesive, how to
listen to each other better, and
how to really work as a group,”
said Baek.

The Dolphins String Quartet
was originally founded by Hen-
derson, Preucil, and cellist Ian
Maloney, and grew with the ad-
dition of violinist Isaac Park. In
their early performances, they
focused on community engage-
ment, playing at local schools and
retirement homes with the goal
of making music accessible to all.

“Our goal is to bring music to
as many people as possible and
to encourage people to believe
in their own musical capacity.
Whether that’s writing music,
loving music, or participating in
any way, we want it to feel ac-
cessible. Making music some-
thing everyone can engage with
— that’s probably our main goal,”
said Preucil.

For Henderson, he explained
that his experience at Andover
played a key role in his career.

Luke Henderson ’21, James Preucil, Ian Maloney, and Isaac Park shared their talents in Falls Music Center.

With the extensive support of
staff and fellow students, Hen-
derson began to believe that a
musical path was possible for
him.

“The resources here, and also
in Boston, put me around people I
never would’ve been able to work
with elsewhere,” he said. “There
was so much excitement around
discovery and exploration I felt
encouraged to try new things, to
be curious. I was surrounded by
peers who were excited to ex-
plore, and adults who had done
that in their own careers and
were eager to support us. That

environment really gave me the
support I needed to grow.”

Advising aspiring musicians,
Preucil stressed the importance
of relationships. Having expe-
rience playing in a quartet, he
emphasized the creative freedom
that emerges when collaborating
with enthusiastic partners. Preu-
cil argued that collaboration is a
gateway to self-exploration and
creativity.

“With only four people, every-
one matters, and you get to know
each other deeply. You learn a lot
about yourself, about collabora-
tion, about communication, and

about relationships in general.”
Henderson added, “There’s this
incredible freedom. We're all
people who aren’t afraid to try
completely new or even crazy
ideas. Whether it’s a phrase in
a piece or a direction the music
could take, everyone jumps in
wholeheartedly. Play as much as
you can with other people. It’s
easy to think the path to success
is spending tons of time alone in
a practice room, and that’s defi-
nitely part of it, but only part. A
lot of the joy comes from sharing
music with others,” said Preucil.

From the Pit to the Fit: What are Andover Students Wearing to Concerts?

LARKIN TECHENTIN ’27

“T attended Dom Dolla at Madi-
son Square Garden. He’s a fun DJ
and producer that makes good
music. He makes mostly house
music, but also some [Electronic
Dance Music] too. [During the
concert] I wore a purple sequined
skirt with a black kind of mesh
sheer long sleeve, and a gold scarf.

I wanted to wear more sequins
or bright colors [because] I feel
like that just made sense for his

kind of music and the vibe of the
concert. I was confused about
how to style the scarf at first,
but I just wrapped it around my
neck like a normal scarf, and then
made it into a balaclava. My outfit
made me feel more excited for the
concert, and I was able to enjoy
it more, really experiencing more
than just listening to the music.”

SARAH BAE’26 (FAR
LEFT)

“1 attended the Zedd concert
in the fall. I started to listen to
house music more this year,
just cause a lot of my friends
have been listening to it more.
Also, I like to listen to it on runs
because it has an upbeat tempo.
Zedd is really catchy, and the
music he plays is good. He does
a lot of good remixes, which are
really well-known. My favorite
part was how they used a lot
of visual effects, like a lot of
different lights, and fire at times
too, making it not just about the
music. I wore a black top, mini
leather shorts, a kind of head
scarf, and glasses. If you have
a good outfit for a concert, it
makes you feel better and more
connected to the music. Also, my
outfit was really comfortable.”

WENDI WEI

From glittering scarves to leather and denim, students at Andover curate bold, expressive looks that match
the energy of their favorite artists. These concert outfits aren’t just about style, they amplify the vibes, deep-
en the connection to the music, and make the moment unforgettable.

FRANCESCA DIZON ’26 (RIGHT)

“I went to Outside Lands, a festival that happens
every summer in San Francisco, and I go every year
with my friends. Almost everyone at home goes, so

it’s really fun to reconnect with people, and I also
get to see friends from Andover... I thrifted my skirt
in Barcelona, and I really liked this piece because it
is pretty unique and fun. I chose this shirt because I

wanted to match the color of the skirt, and the head-
scarf is my mom’s, which she got from her mom. My
boots were also my moms.”

REGAN DRISCOLL ’28

“T went to Country Fest. The con-
cert was on August 24. It was at
Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.
When we were there, we saw
Megan Moroney, Zac Brown, and
Kenny Chesney. I like these art-
ists because I grew up listening
to them with my family, and they
have good vibes, so it was really
cool to see them all in person. I
wore jean shorts, Vejas, and a top
from Edikted. I styled myself this
way because I felt like it gave off
the summer vibe, and my shirt
had akind of country vibe [and]
I was gonna wear a skirt, [but]
then I wore jean shorts, [which
made me feel] much more com-
fortable and free to move. My
favorite part of my outfit was my
shirt. I’ve never worn it before,
so wearing it [for the] first time
made the moment special. The
shirt is a blue backless gingham
tank top.”

ROHAN AGRAWAL ’26
(LEFT)

“(I went] to a three-day music
festival called Outside Lands in
San Francisco in August. I went

with my good friend Ethan Oder
[25] and I wore this outfit on day
one of the festival. On day one,
we saw multiple artists includ-
ing Daniel Caesar, Kevin Ab-
stract, and Tyla. When we were
brainstorming outfits, we were
inspired by one of Brent Faiyaz’s
outfits where he wore a white
shirt with a tie, blue jeans, anda
black jacket. We thought it was
cool, so we decided to recreate
that. I thought wearing a tie was
fun because I was dressing up
a little more than everyone else
at the festival, which was a cool
experience.”

NATHANIEL DAROCHA

With a steady hand on the
mixer and a sharp ear for un-
expected song pairings, Arashi
Hunter ’25 has turned a sum-
mer hobby into a viral presence,
amassing over 100,000 likes on
his TikTok DJ account, @notrig-
by. From bedroom mixes to An-
dover dance floors, Hunter has
started to build a name for him-
self, one beat drop at a time.

Hunter’s DJing journey start-
ed with borrowed equipment
that was gathering dust in his
home. He found himself increas-
ingly drawn to the equipment
and began experimenting with
it out of curiosity. The equip-
ment unofficially became his as
he spent more time understand-
ing the specifics of mixing. Over
the course of almost two years,
DJing has transformed from an
occasional curiosity into a reg-
ular hobby and source of joy for
Hunter.

“My sister got some of the
equipment two summers ago
that she was going to use herself.
She got a mixer and some speak-
ers. But I was the one [who] end-
ed up using it. In turn, it kind of
became mine. I’ve been DJing for
almost two years now. It’s been a
lot of fun. I thought it [would] be
a good skill to have,” said Hunter.

Hunter’s approach to music is
based on experimentation and an
acute ear for musical detail. He
invests time in trying out unusual

combinations in an effort to dis-
cover unexpected harmonies.
When discovering a mash-up
that appeals to him, he records a
brief video and posts it to TikTok,
where he has amassed a special-
ized following interested in his
approach.

“It’s a lot of trial and error. I
just try to find two songs. They
have to be in the same key and
have a similar [Beats per Min-
ute] that sounds good together
in a mix. I'll record myself DJing,
a 30-second clip, and post that
on TikTok. There’s this one guy,
Nick Cheo, on TikTok who kind
of posts similar content to what I
do. You know, mixing two songs
that you might not think go well
together, so that’s what I’ve got-
ten into,’ said Hunter.

Hunter has performed at An-
dover events like the Neon Dance
and the Battle of the DJs, provid-
ing a meaningful artistic contri-
bution to the campus community.
Friends like Michael Williamson
’25 recognize how rare it is for a
student at Andover to maintain a
dedicated DJing TikTok account
and continue to bring standout
sets to campus events.

“The fact that he even has a
DJing account is pretty unique
for a student DJ here at Ando-
ver. He’s definitely able to kind of
bring his own aesthetic to dances,
whether it be through what he’s
wearing or just the songs he’s
playing. It adds to his own style
and the mark that he’s making
each performance. Being a DJ at
Andover is very challenging be-

Arashi Hunter ’25 sports a DJ set in his room.

cause even getting a good show
out at dances is pretty difficult in
and of itself. Having the ability to
go to a dance when you know, es-
pecially in the first 30 minutes or
so, it’ll probably be pretty dead,
and to be able to sit at the DJ ta-
ble and put on good transitions
and good music, that’s very admi-
rable,’ said Williamson.

For Hunter, the allure of DJing
is its accessibility — all you need
is a computer, a mixer, and the
willingness to try new things.
Without feeling obliged to de-
fine an exact objective, he con-
centrates on having fun, posting
often, and following his musical
interests.

“(Getting into DJing] is rela-
tively accessible. I guess you just

gotta have a computer and the
mixer itself. I’m still on a pretty
beginner setup. I did the Neon
Dance, and I just did the Battle of
the DJs Dance. I wouldn’t say [I
have] necessarily a specific goal.
I just continue to post when I
can and keep it going wherever it
takes me,” said Hunter.

Sebastian Lemberger ’25’s Clothing Curriculum: Dressing Distinctively and Diligently

ADEN HWANG

Donning a collared shirt
tucked underneath a pastel
sweater, Sebastian Lemberger
25 completes his outfit with
a tan blazer and matching
tan pants. Through striding
along campus in academic at-
tire, Lemberger has crafted a
signature, recognizable look
for himself. His closet can be
described as a sea of beige —
his favorite color — and he
rotates outfits between his fa-
vorite scarves, sweaters, and
overcoats that each hold a
special, personal name.

In a quest to look as smart
as possible, Lemberger sacri-
fices comfort for the appear-
ance of intellect. His style
echoes that of professors and
scholars, using fashion to cu-
rate a similar intellectual im-
age onto himself.

“My greatest aspiration in
life is to appear smarter than
I actually am. It’s the only
thing to which I aspire and
every decision I’ve ever made
in my life is done with the ob-
jective of appearing smarter
than I actually am. As such,
I tend to dress in a way that
makes people who walk past
me look at me and go, ‘wow,
he must be exceptionally in-
telligent’” I wear blazers and
lots of scarves and wool over-
coats and other sort of profes-
sorial pieces of clothing,” said
Lemberger.

As a result of his scholarly
style, many have told Lem-
berger that his outfits resem-
ble the dark academia style.
However, Lemberger was not
familiar with this style origi-
nally, and attributes his fash-
ion inspiration to his grandfa-
ther, whom he received many
of his clothes from.

“lve been told by other
people, not myself, that my
style could be classified as

Last weekend’s  Susie’s
karaoke rewrote the usual
script, with performer John
Rush commanding the stage
for the night. This contrast-
ed previous student-led ka-
raoke events. Rush strummed
to songs from artists like The
Black Eyed Peas and Journey.

Despite this, the student
attendance was initially low-
er than anticipated, hinting
at the growing disconnect
between the administration’s
choices for student enter-
tainment and the students’
preferences. However, Sophia
Lazar ’26, noted that the night
eventually brought people

dark academia. I didn’t know
what dark academia was un-
til two years ago. I suppose it
could be labeled as inspired
by that, even though it techni-
cally wasn’t. I also get a lot of
clothing from my grandfather,
who’s like 80. And so just part
of that leads me to dress like
an 80-year-old man very fre-
quently. So I guess he’s the
closest thing to a fashion
muse that I have, mainly be-
cause I own a lot of his cloth-
ing,” said Lemberger.

In middle school, Lem-
berger’s style was bolder, and
exuded even more intellect.
Wearing a bow tie to classes
everyday, he was given the
nickname, “Young Sheldon.”
Desiring the same reputation,
but not the nickname, he lost
the bow tie and toned down
his outfits for high school.

“Fun fact. In middle school,
I wore a bow tie to school ev-
ery day. The other kids in my
class called me Young Shel-
don. So I figured it was basi-
cally the equivalent of what I
dress like now, except maybe
toned up a bit. I figured, in
high school, I’d do something
similar, but maybe a bit more
mellow. So no one called me
Young Sheldon,” said Lem-
berger.

Known for his long coats,
Lemberger described his
unique tradition of naming
these articles of clothing.

“Probably my coats would
be what most people say [I am
known for] because I actually
name all my coats. The names
are Todd, Eugene, and Ger-
ald. The gray one is named
Todd, the black one is named
Eugene, and the beige one is
named Gerald. Todd I’ve had
for the longest,” said Lem-
berger.

Though Lemberger’s clos-
et does not vary in aesthetic,
through simple calculations,
he has found that he can add
variation in his daily outfits

through wearing different
combinations of pants and
shirts.

“Every morning I wake up,
I go to my closet, I see what’s
clean. Based on that, I choose
a shirt and then whatever pair
of pants goes with that shirt.
I recently found I own more
sweaters than I do pants,
which is awful. Mathemat-
ically, I have at least 10 pos-
sible pants combinations for
every shirt combination, and
Ihave more shirts than pants,
and then sweaters. That’s at

east 10 to the third power. So
at least a thousand possible
outfits, probably more,” said
Lemberger.

Lemberger only ever allows
himself to dress down when
he knows no one will see him.
Whether that’s in the com-
fort of his room, or away from
school, he’ll wear a much sim-
pler t-shirt or hoodie. Howev-
er, in the presence of anybody
he knows, he refuses to stray
from his signature scholarly
style.

“T try never to deviate from
the scholarly path, except

John Rush Reshapes Karaoke Night at the Susie’s

together to enjoy the atmo-
sphere created by Rush.

“For around the first half of
the event there weren’t many
people there. There were ac-
tually more faculty members,
so it was a really cool crowd.
People were engaging with
John Rush, the guy who was
performing, but there was
pretty low attendance at first.
But then once it got later,
more towards 10:00, which
would be the start of Senior
Hour, a lot of the Seniors
started rolling in, so the place
filled up a lot more,” said La-
zar.

Nevada Charity ’26 de-
scribed one benefit of Rush’s
performance as the sustained
on-stage energy. Unlike our
other karaoke shows, where
the mood is determined by

whether or not students
chose to brave the stage,
Rush’s show continued to go
on. Through a streamlined,
continuous set of songs, the

atmosphere always flowed
with the melodies and sing-
alongs.

“The crowd was invited to
engage in singing along from
their seats as well as getting
on stage and singing songs
that they had requested on
stage. It was very interactive,
and [John Rush] encouraged
us to participate. Or even if
you wanted to sit and listen
along, and bop your head that
way, much of the crowd inter-
acted with the performance.”

Lazar echoed similar sen-
timents, as the performance
gave Lazar a chance to rec-
ommend her own favourite

songs. In doing so, audience
members remained involved,
despite Rush being the main
performer.

“It was pretty interactive. I
mean he was calling on peo-
ple and asking questions. He
called on me just to be like,
‘Hi what’s your name? What
decade of songs do you want
me to sing?’ And I just said
’80s [songs] but he was doing
that to a few people and also
he was encouraging people to
come up on stage and sing,”
said Lazar.

Lazar recounted how the
music ranged from ’70s tracks
to present day trending songs.
By appealing to a wide range
of people, Rush ensured that
everyone felt included.

“He just had so many
songs available and a lot of

sometimes on weekends, I
don’t want to button a full
button-down shirt. So in that
case, I’ll wear a hoodie or
something, usually if I don’t
intend on being seen in pub-
lic at all. But if I have a class
or a meeting or something
like that on a given day, I will
usually assume my normal
dress. And then in the sum-
mer, I usually wear t-shirts,
again, because no one sees me
from school. They can never
know,” said Lemberger.

the songs that he was playing
were like older songs or older
for our generation, more like
’70s, ’80s, [or] 90s music, so
it’s fun to see the faculty that
were there also be really en-
gaged. I didn’t really expect
there to be so many faculty
members,” said Lazar.

Audience members, such
as Chris Lee ’27, were struck
by Rush’s vocal talent, which
was laced with devotion to-
wards his craft.

“He has a really riveting
voice. Really thoughtful with
it. ’d say he puts a lot of pas-
sion into his voice. He really
is a human spotify. He knows
all the lyrics, a lot of them. He
was talking to the people who
would be in the crowd, and
the crowd was interested.”
