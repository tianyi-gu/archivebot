what it's renowned for: fast
limes, deep competition, and
an atmosphere that caus-
e you to appreciage why
people remain enamored of
Track & Field. It's not driven
by halftime shows or mar-
keting craze; id's buike by
impressive performances,
which makes it se special.

‘What also maki Fenn fe-
lays so exciting is ors history.
The meet has happemed ev-
ary year sone 1804, making
toms: of the okbest and most

try. Penn Relava is tradidion-
ally where the US's best

sprinting legends Usaim Bolt
and ‘Yoham Blake ran the
42000 bogether af Penn Ae-
lays before they wom gold ar
the DOLE London Olympics
only two years later. Osher
Track & Field legends like
Carl Lewis and Jexse Grwens
participated in Penn Relays
before their Olympic super-
stardom. Generations of ach-
letes have raced on Franklin
Field's surface, and for many
high schoolers, it's their first
big meet. There's a weight
