north of Hartford, Con-

wasted to do with my
life. [ abways thought
mavhe if l eould werk ie

understand and families
understand that there's

just think technology has
changed theway, and the
Pandemic certainly, bot
irs ehanged the Way Wwe

chgage with each oth-

instant gratification, “ll

Even when 0 chink who
