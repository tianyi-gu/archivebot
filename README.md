# This is ArchiveBot

This project aims to develop an AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that  enables intuitive, conversational access to archived materials from the Oliver Wendell Holmes  library. This would be available to students, librarians, faculty, and any others who are curious about  engaging with the school's history in an accessible manner. This project will enable users to leverage  natural language search, in order for users to be able to retrieve summaries and context-rich  information from historical documents.

Developed in the Computer Science 600 Research and Development Class at Phillips Academy.
